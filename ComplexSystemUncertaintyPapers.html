               	   	    The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices within homes raises many security and privacy concerns. Recent headlines highlight the lack of effective security mechanisms in IoT devices. Security threats in IoT arise not only from vulnerabilities in individual devices but also from the composition of devices in unanticipated ways and the ability of devices to interact through both cyber and physical channels. Existing approaches provide methods for monitoring cyber interactions between devices but fail to consider possible physical interactions. To overcome this challenge, it is essential that security assessments of IoT networks take a holistic view of the network and treat it as a "system of systems", in which security is defined, not solely by the individual systems, but also by the interactions and trust dependencies between systems.
                        In this paper, we propose a way of modeling cyber and physical interactions between IoT devices of a given network. By verifying the cyber and physical interactions against user-defined policies, our model can identify unexpected chains of events that may be harmful. It can also be applied to determine the impact of the addition (or removal) of a device into an existing network with respect to dangerous device interactions.
                        We demonstrate the viability of our approach by instantiating our model using Alloy, a language and tool for relational models. In our evaluation, we considered three realistic IoT use cases and demonstrate that our model is capable of identifying potentially dangerous device interactions. We also measure the performance of our approach with respect to the CPU runtime and memory consumption of the Alloy model finder, and show that it is acceptable for smart-home IoT networks.

               	   	  The electric grid had become a vast complex cyber-physical system, and its digitalization is a reality in the close future that would result in a tremendous amount of information, controls, and uncertainties. Distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed generation (DG), demand response (DR), distributed energy storage systems (DESS), and electric vehicle (EV) are increasing the level of uncertainty but also the capabilities of new controls on the distribution networks. The future electric grid will need more flexibility and coordination between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to be able to operate in a reliable, secure and economical fashion. To overcome uncertainties and reliability issues, DSO is moving toward the so-called active distribution network (ADN) which is the crucial piece of for enabling new flexibility at the TSO level. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the estimation of the ADNs flexibility based on the feasibility region at the TSO-DSO interface. A Monte Carlo sampling method is applied to generate random ADN states. The proposed methodology is analyzed in both the 5-bus ring distribution test system and the 33-bus IEEE radial distribution system.

               	   	  By nature, Cyber-physical systems are very often subjected to uncertainty events that can occur in their environment. This paper presents the first results of our work on how to deal with environment uncertainty in goal-based requirements engineering. This work is motivated by the fact that current goal-based approaches do not natively allow for unanticipated adaptations. To do so, we explore the introduction of RELAX concepts into SysMLKaos. RELAX is a Requirements Engineering language for Dynamically Adaptive Systems that includes explicit constructs to handle the inherent uncertainty in these systems. On the other hand, SysMLKaos is a Goal Based Requirements Engineering approach that takes into account Non-Functional Requirements at the same level of abstraction as Functional Requirements and models the impact of Non-Functional Requirements on Functional Requirements. We use an extract of a Landing Gear System case study to illustrate the proposed approach.

               	   	  Active automata learning algorithms have gained increasing importance in the field of model-based system verification. For some classes of systems - especially deterministic systems, like Mealy machines, a variety of learning algorithm implementations is readily available. In this paper, we apply this technique to a measurement device from the automotive industry in order to systematically test its behaviour. However, our system under learning shows sparse non-deterministic behaviour, preventing the direct application of the available learning tools.
											We propose an implementation of the active automata learning framework which masks this non-determinism. We repeat a previous model-based testing experiment with faulty devices and show that we can detect all injected faults. Most importantly, our technique was also able to find unknown bugs.

               	   	  Internet of Things (IoT) data analytics is underpinning numerous applications, however, the task is still challenging predominantly due to heterogeneous IoT data streams, unreliable networks, and ever increasing size of the data. In this context, we propose a two-layer architecture for analyzing IoT data. The first layer provides a generic interface using a service oriented gateway to ingest data from multiple interfaces and IoT systems, store it in a scalable manner and analyze it in real-time to extract high-level events; whereas second layer is responsible for probabilistic fusion of these high-level events. In the second layer, we extend state-of-the-art event processing using Bayesian networks in order to take uncertainty into account while detecting complex events. We implement our proposed solution using open source components optimized for large-scale applications. We demonstrate our solution on real-world use-case in the domain of intelligent transportation system where we analyzed traffic, weather, and social media data streams from Madrid city in order to predict probability of congestion in real-time. The performance of the system is evaluated qualitatively using a web-interface where traffic administrators can provide the feedback about the quality of predictions and quantitatively using F-measure with an accuracy of over 80%.

               	   	  Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been deployed to monitor network activity and to protect systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices from attacks (or intrusions). The problem with these systems is that they generate a huge amount of inappropriate false alarms whenever abnormal activities are detected and they are not too flexible for a complex environment. The high-level rate of the generated false alarms reduces the performance of IDS against cyber-attacks and makes the tasks of the security analyst particularly difficult and the management of intrusion detection process computationally expensive. We study here one of the challenging aspects of computer and network security and we propose to build a detection model for both known and unknown intrusions (or anomaly detection) via a novel nonparametric Bayesian model. The design of our framework can be extended easily to be adequate for IoT technology and notably for intelligent smart city web-based applications. In our method, we learn the patterns of the activities (both normal and anomalous) through a Bayesian-based MCMC inference for infinite bounded generalized Gaussian mixture models. Contrary to classic clustering methods, our approach does not need to specify the number of clusters, takes into consideration the uncertainty via the introduction of prior knowledge for the parameters of the model, and permits to solve problems related to over- and under-fitting. In order to get better clustering performance, feature weights, model's parameters, and the number of clusters are estimated simultaneously and automatically. The developed approach was evaluated using popular data sets. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in detecting various attacks.

               	   	 Multi-objective uncertainty-wise test case minimization focuses on selecting a minimum number of test cases to execute out of all available ones while maximizing effectiveness (e.g., coverage), minimizing cost (e.g., time to execute test cases), and at the same time optimizing uncertainty-related objectives. In our previous unpublished work, we developed four uncertainty-wise test case minimization strategies relying on Uncertainty Theory and multi-objective search (NSGA-II with default settings), which were evaluated with one real Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with inherent uncertainty. However, a fundamental question to answer is whether these default settings of NSGA-II are good enough to provide optimized solutions. In this direction, we report one of the preliminary empirical evaluations, where we performed an experiment with three different mutation operators and three crossover operators, i.e., in total nine combinations with NSGA-II for the four uncertainty-wise test case minimization strategies using a real CPS case study. Results show that the Blend Alpha crossover operator together with the polynomial mutation operator permits NSGA-II achieving the best performance for solving our uncertainty-wise test minimization problems.

               	   	As compared with classical software/system testing, uncertainty-wise testing explicitly addresses known uncertainty about the behavior of a System Under Test (SUT), its operating environment, and interactions between the SUT and its operational environment, across all testing phases, including test design, test generation, test optimization, and test execution, with the aim to mainly achieve the following two goals. First, uncertainty-wise testing aims to ensure that the SUT deals with known uncertainty adequately. Second, uncertainty-wise testing should be also capable of learning new (previously unknown) uncertainties such that the SUT's implementation can be improved to guard against newly learned uncertainties during its operation. The necessity to integrate uncertainty in testing is becoming imperative because of the emergence of new types of intelligent and communicating software-based systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Intrinsically, such systems are exposed to uncertainty because of their interactions with highly indeterminate physical environments. In this chapter, we provide our understanding and experience of uncertainty-wise testing from the aspects of uncertainty-wise model-based testing, uncertainty-wise modeling and evolution of test ready models, and uncertainty-wise multiobjective test optimization, in the context of testing CPSs under uncertainty. Furthermore, we present our vision about this new testing paradigm and its plausible future research directions.

               	   	In the cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) environments, quantifying uncertainty is an important element input to keep the acceptable level of reliability in various configurations. In this paper, we aim to address the pricing model of delivering data over the cloud while taking into consideration the dynamic uncertainty factors such as network topology, transmission/reception energy, nodal charge and power, and computation capacity. These uncertainty factors are mapped to different nodes with varying capabilities to be processed using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms. Accordingly, we aim to find a way to calculate and predict the price per big data service over the cloud using AI and deep learning. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework to address big data delivery issues in cloud-based IoT environments by considering uncertainty factors. We compare the performance of the framework using two AI-based techniques called Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) in both centralized and distributed versions. The use of AI techniques can be applied in multilevel to provide a kind of deep learning to further improve the performance of the system under study. The results reveal that the distributed algorithm outperforms the centralized one. In addition, the results show that the GA has lower running time compared to the SAA in all the test cases such as 68% of improvement in the centralized version, and 66% of improvement in the distributed version in case when the size of uncertainty array is 256. Moreover, when the size of uncertainty array increases, the results show 60% speed up in the distributed GA compared to its centralized version. The improvements achieved would help the service providers to actually improve their profit using the proposed framework.

               	   	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are composed of computing devices interacting with physical systems. Model-based design is a powerful methodology in CPS design in the implementation of control systems. For instance, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is typically implemented in CPS applications, e.g., in path tracking of autonomous vehicles. MPC deploys a model to estimate the behavior of the physical system at future time instants for a specific time horizon. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) are the most commonly used models to emulate the behavior of continuous-time (non-)linear dynamical systems. A complex physical model may comprise thousands of ODEs which pose scalability, performance and power consumption challenges. One approach to address these model complexity challenges are frameworks that automate the development of model-to-model transformation. In this paper, we introduce a model generation framework to transform ODE models of a physical system to Hybrid Harmonic Equivalent State (HES) Machine model equivalents. Moreover, tuning parameters are introduced to reconfigure the model and adjust its accuracy from coarse-grained time critical situations to fine-grained scenarios in which safety is paramount. Machine learning techniques are applied to adopt the model to run-time applications. We conduct experiments on a closed-loop MPC for path tracking using the vehicle dynamics model. We analyze the performance of the MPC when applying our Hybrid HES Machine model. The performance of our proposed model is compared with state-of-the-art ODE-based models, in terms of execution time and model accuracy. Our experimental results show a 32% reduction in MPC return time for 0.8% loss in model accuracy.

               	   	Having a shared and accurate sense of time is critical to distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols, it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed systems with unprecedented accuracy. However, applications have not benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services that help manage time, and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces through which timing information flows to the application. Due to the importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications, running on commodity platforms and operating systems, it is imperative to rethink how time is handled across the system stack. We advocate the adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time (QoT) that captures metrics such as resolution, accuracy, and stability. Building on this notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time is a controllable operating system primitive with observable uncertainty, and where time synchronization balances applications' timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth. Our architecture features an expressive application programming interface that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline - a virtual temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide its components with a shared sense of time, with a desired accuracy and resolution. The timeline abstraction enables developers to easily write applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space. Leveraging open source hardware and software components, we have implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform. Results from its evaluation are also presented.

               	   	For an effective use of a robotic prosthetic, smooth transition between the states of this human-in-the-loop cyber-physical system (or autonomous operation) is crucial. In order to achieve that, taking into account the uncertainties in the robotic system may be as significant as anticipating the human intent. In this study, we present two risk measures associated with a simple grasping task based on the pre-grasp position and orientation of the robotic hand, and analyze them by using a model of a dexterous mechatronic prosthetic arm to simulate a simple grasping task. Moreover, we develop a hybrid position and force grasp controller and use a grasp quality metric to assess the grasps. 34 simulations with different pre-grasp poses were performed to investigate the relationship between the grasp quality and the risk measures as well as the sensitivity of the grasp quality to the pre-grasp position of the hand. Results show that the proposed risk metrics and the pre-grasp position correlate with the grasp quality, yet they are not sufficient to predict the outcome.

               	   	We study the problem of checking weighted CTL properties for weighted Kripke structures in presence of imprecise weights. We consider two extensions of the notion of weighted Kripke structures, namely (i) parametric weighted Kripke structures, having transitions weights modelled as affine maps over a set of parameters and, (ii) weight-uncertain Kripke structures, having transition labelled by real-valued random variables as opposed to precise real valued weights.
										We address this problem by using extended parametric dependency graphs, a symbolic extension of dependency graphs by Liu and Smolka. Experiments performed with a prototype tool implementation show that our approach outperforms by orders of magnitude an adaptation of a state-of-the-art tool for WKSs.

               	   	Development of robust dynamical systems and networks such as autonomous aircraft systems capable of accomplishing complex missions faces challenges due to the dynamically evolving uncertainties coming from model uncertainties, necessity to operate in a hostile cluttered urban environment, and the distributed and dynamic nature of the communication and computation resources. Model-based robust design is difficult because of the complexity of the hybrid dynamic models including continuous vehicle dynamics, the discrete models of computations and communications, and the size of the problem. We will overview recent advances in methodology and tools to model, analyze, and design robust autonomous aerospace systems operating in uncertain environment, with stress on efficient uncertainty quantification and robust design using the case studies of the mission including model-based target tracking and search, and trajectory planning in uncertain urban environment. To show that the methodology is generally applicable to uncertain dynamical systems, we will also show examples of application of the new methods to efficient uncertainty quantification of energy usage in buildings, and stability assessment of interconnected power networks.

               	   	Conventionally, the exposure regarding knowledge of the inter vehicle link duration is a significant parameter in Vehicular Networks to estimate the delay during the failure of a specific link during the transmission. However, the mobility and dynamics of the nodes is considerably higher in a smart city than on highways and thus could emerge a complex random pattern for the investigation of the link duration, referring all sorts of uncertain conditions. There are existing link duration estimation models, which perform linear operations under linear relationships without imprecise conditions. Anticipating, the requirement to tackle the uncertain conditions in Vehicular Networks, this paper presents a hybrid neural network-driven mobility prediction model. The proposed hybrid neural network comprises a Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann machine (FCBM), which allows the random patterns of several vehicles in a single time stamp to be learned. The several dynamic parameters, which may make the contexts of Vehicular Networks uncertain, could be vehicle speed at the moment of prediction, the number of leading vehicles, the average speed of the leading vehicle, the distance to the subsequent intersection of traffic roadways and the number of lanes in a road segment. In this paper, a novel method of hybrid intelligence is initiated to tackle such uncertainty. Here, the Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine (FCBM) is a stochastic graph model that can learn joint probability distribution over its visible units (say n) and hidden feature units (say m). It is evident that there must be a prime driving parameter of the holistic network, which will monitor the interconnection of weights and biases of the Vehicular Network for all these features. The highlight of this paper is that the prime driving parameter to control the learning process should be a fuzzy number, as fuzzy logic is used to represent the vague and uncertain parameters. Therefore, if uncertainty exists due to the random patterns caused by vehicle mobility, the proposed Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine could remove the noise from the data representation. Thus, the proposed model will be able to predict robustly the mobility in VANET, referring any instance of link failure under Vehicular Network paradigm.

               	   	A fundamental problem in the design of closed-loop Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is in accurately capturing the dynamics of the underlying physical system. To provide optimal control for such closed-loop systems, model-based controls require accurate physical plant models. It is hard to analytically establish (a) how data quality from sensors affects model accuracy, and consequently, (b) the effect of model accuracy on the operational cost of model-based controllers. We present the Model-IQ toolbox which, given a plant model and real input data, automatically evaluates the effect of this uncertainty propagation from sensor data to model accuracy to controller performance. We apply the Model-IQ uncertainty analysis for model-based controls in buildings to demonstrate the cost-benefit of adding temporary sensors to capture a building model. We show how sensor placement and density bias training data. For the real building considered, a bias of 1% degrades model accuracy by 20%. Model-IQ's automated process lowers the cost of sensor deployment, model training and evaluation of advanced controls for small and medium sized buildings. Such end-to-end analysis of uncertainty propagation has the potential to lower the cost for CPS with closed-loop model based control. We demonstrate this with real building data in the Department of Energy's HUB.

So, for a particular time period, it is very tough to find the appropriate data for its certainty. In this paper, all received sensor data are to be assumed as fuzzy numbers, and such assumption could be beneficial to improve the functionality of data availability and accessibility in service-oriented architecture (SOA) system. Whenever any service is requested for updated sensor data, it must be handled through well-defined architecture, and this is governed by enterprise service bus (ESB). This ESB extends the features for SOA as well as strengthen the service middleware architecture. Sensor data received through this ESB would need corrections and cleanliness which could be done through fuzzy theory and help in reducing the uncertainty in data.

               	   			As Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical systems become more ubiquitous and an integral part of our daily lives, it is important that we are able to trust the data aggregate from such systems. However, the interpretation of trustworthiness is contextual and varies according to the risk tolerance attitude of the concerned application and varying levels of uncertainty associated with the evidence upon which trust models act. Hence, the data integrity scoring mechanisms should have provisions to adapt to varying risk attitudes and uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian inference model and a prospect theoretic framework for data integrity scoring that quantify the trustworthiness of data collected from IoT devices by a hub in the presence of an adversary manipulating data and an imperfect anomaly monitoring mechanism. The monitoring mechanism monitors the data being sent from each device and classifies the outcome as not compromised, compromised, and cannot be inferred. These outcomes are conceptualized as a multinomial hypothesis of a Bayesian inference model with three parameters which are then used for calculating a utility value on how reliable the aggregate data is. We use prospect theory inspired approach to quantify this data integrity score and evaluate trustworthiness of the aggregate data from the IoT framework. As decisions are based on how the data is fused, we propose two measuring models-one optimistic and another conservative. The proposed framework is validated using extensive simulation experiments. We show how data integrity scores vary under a variety of system factors like attack intensity and inaccurate detection.

                           In many IoT applications, sensor nodes are distributed over a region of interests and collect
                           data at a specified time interval. With the development of hardware, the monitoring tasks
                           become diversity. The specified acquisition strategy can not adaptively adjust the sampling
                           interval. Due to the measurement error and the uncertainty of the environment, equi-frequency
                           sampling technique may result in misunderstandings to the physical world. Based on Taylor
                           expansion and time series analysis, this paper presents a sensed data model. The model can be
                           considered as a unified approach, where linear regression or spline interpolation is a
                           special case of our model. A mathematical method for parameter estimation is proposed, which
                           can minimize the measurement error. And we prove the estimation is unbias. An adaptive data
                           acquisition algorithm is proposed. Performance evaluation on the real data set verifies that
                           the proposed algorithms have high performance in terms of accuracy and effectiveness.

                           Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems are usually composed of thousands of different components
                           among hardware devices and different software modules. In order to address the design of
                           these complex systems, different abstraction layers are usually defined. However, as these
                           layers are isolated, highlevel components always have uncertainty about the nature of the
                           low-level components they relate with. In particular, as low-level component identities are
                           not known by user applications, and current IoT systems are vulnerable to the injection of
                           new components and to the modification of the behavior of existing ones (adequate security
                           solutions at the network level for these problems have not been found yet), the reliability
                           of the received data is generally compromised. In this context, new mechanisms are required
                           to avoid the interactions or directly remove the malicious components relying on high-level
                           information. This paper describes a statistical framework to discover IoT components with
                           malicious behaviors, using a hybrid reputation model. On the one hand, an implicit reputation
                           definition is employed, based on the observations made by a certain IoT component and other
                           modules it relies on. On the other hand, an explicit reputation model considers a scheme of
                           recommendations and negative grades. The proposed solution is evaluated in a simulation
                           scenario by using the NS3 simulator, in order to perform an experimental validation.

                           Neural State Classification (NSC) [19] is a scalable method for the analysis of hybrid
                           systems, which consists in learning a neural network-based classifier able to detect whether
                           or not an unsafe state can be reached from a certain configuration of a hybrid system. NSC
                           has very high accuracy, yet it is prone to prediction errors that can affect system safety.
                           To overcome this limitation, we present a method, based on the theory of conformal
                           prediction, that complements NSC predictions with statistically sound estimates of prediction
                           uncertainty. This results in a principled criterion to reject potentially erroneous
                           predictions a priori, i.e., without knowing the true reachability values. Our approach is
                           highly efficient (with runtimes in the order of milliseconds) and effective, managing in our
                           experiments to successfully reject almost all the wrong NSC predictions.

                           Design decisions made during early development stages of self-adaptive systems tend to have a
                           significant impact upon system properties at run time (e.g., safety, QoS). However,
                           understanding the implications of these decisions a priori is difficult due to the different
                           types and degrees of uncertainty that affect such systems (e.g., simplifying assumptions,
                           human-in-the-loop). To provide some assurances about self-adaptive system designs, evidence
                           can be gathered from activities such as simulations and prototyping, but these demand a
                           significant effort and do not provide a systematic way of dealing with uncertainty. In this
                           chapter, we describe an approach based on model checking of stochastic multiplayer games
                           (SMGs) that enables developers to approximate the behavioral envelope of a self-adaptive
                           system by analyzing best- and worst-case scenarios of alternative designs for self-adaptation
                           mechanisms. Compared to other sources of evidence, such as simulations or prototypes, our
                           approach is purely declarative and hence has the potential of providing developers with a
                           preliminary understanding of adaptation behavior with less effort, and without the need to
                           have any specific adaptation algorithms or infrastructure in place. We illustrate our
                           approach by showing how it can be used to mitigate different types of uncertainty in contexts
                           such as self-protecting systems, proactive latency-aware adaptation, and human-in-the-loop
                           adaptation.

                           Designing software in a way that guarantees run-time behavior while achieving an acceptable
                           balance among multiple quality attributes is an open problem. Providing guarantees about the
                           satisfaction of the same requirements under uncertain environments is even more challenging.
                           Tools and techniques to inform engineers about poorly-understood design spaces in the
                           presence of uncertainty are needed, so that engineers can explore the design space,
                           especially when tradeoffs are crucial. To tackle this problem, we describe an approach that
                           combines synthesis of spaces of system design alternatives from formal specifications of
                           architectural styles with probabilistic formal verification. The main contribution of this
                           paper is a formal framework for specification-driven synthesis and analysis of design spaces

                           is treated as a first-class entity. We illustrate our approach in two case studies: a
                           service-based adaptive system and a mobile robotics architecture. Our results show how the
                           framework can provide useful insights into how average case probabilistic guarantees can
                           differ from worst case guarantees, emphasizing the relevance of combining quantitative formal
                           verification methods with structural synthesis, in contrast with techniques based on
                           simulation and dynamic analysis that can only provide estimates about average case
                           probabilistic properties.

                           Self-Adaptive systems are expected to adapt to unanticipated run-time events using imperfect
                           information about their environment. This entails handling the effects of uncertainties in
                           decision-making, which are not always considered as a first-class concern. This paper
                           contributes a formal analysis technique that explicitly considers uncertainty in sensing when
                           reasoning about the best way to adapt, possibly executing uncertainty reduction operations to
                           improve system utility. We illustrate our approach on a Denial of Service (DoS) attack
                           scenario and present some preliminary results that show the benefits of uncertainty-aware
                           decision-making with respect to using an uncertainty-ignorant approach.

                           Through digitisation of physical artefacts and environments, the Internet of Things carries
                           vast potential for process innovation. However, navigation of the quickly evolving
                           technological landscape and identification of emerging opportunities for value creation
                           remains challenging. To this end, we combine existing frameworks on information requirements,
                           IT capability, and business value of IT. We evaluate the usability of these frameworks for
                           IoT enabled innovation in our analysis of two sensor-based process innovation projects. We
                           investigate the fit between process characteristics and technological functionality, and the
                           implications of this alignment. Our analysis demonstrates that the framework provides a
                           practically useful and theoretically coherent conceptual device for analyzing process
                           characteristics and digital options to innovate processes. Furthermore, we find that IoT
                           sensors are well suited to address connectivity and uncertainty requirements. However, in
                           order to leverage them to address high equivocality requirements designers need deep
                           contextual understanding to align IoT capability with information requirements.

                           The problem of building statistical models of cyber-physical systems using operational data
                           is addressed in this paper, using thecase study of aircraft engines. These models serve as a
                           complementto physics-based models, which may not accurately reflect the operational
                           performance of systems. The accurate modeling of fuelflow rate is an essential aspect of
                           analyzing aircraft engine performance. In this paper, operational data from Flight Data
                           Recordersare used to model the fuel flow rate. The independent variablesare restricted to
                           those which are obtainable from trajectory data.Treating the engine as a statistical system,
                           an algorithm based onGaussian Process Regression (GPR) is developed to estimate thefuel flow
                           rate during the airborne phases of flight. The algorithmpropagates the uncertainty in the
                           estimates in order to determineprediction intervals. The proposed GPR models are evaluated
                           fortheir predictive performance on an independent set of flights. Theresulting estimates are
                           also compared with those given by the Baseof Aircraft Data (BADA) model, which is widely used
                           in aircraftperformance studies. The GPR models are shown to perform statistically
                           significantly better than the BADA model. The GPR modelsalso provide interval estimates for
                           the fuel flow rate which reflectthe variability seen in the data, presenting a promising
                           approachfor data-driven modeling of cyber-physical systems.

                     As software applications become highly interconnected in dynamically provisioned platforms, they form the so-called systems-of-systems. Therefore, a key issue that arises in such environments is whether specific requirements are violated, when these applications interact in new unforeseen ways as new resources or system components are dynamically provisioned. Such environments require the continuous use of frameworks for assessing compliance against specific mission critical system requirements. Such frameworks should be able to (a) handle large requirements models, (b) assess system compliance repeatedly and frequently using events from possibly high velocity and high frequency data streams, and (c) use models that can reflect the vagueness that inherently exists in big data event collection and in modeling dependencies between components of complex and dynamically re-configured systems. In this paper, we introduce a framework for run time reasoning over medium and large-scale fuzzy goal models, and we propose a process which allows for the parallel evaluation of such models. The approach has been evaluated for time and space performance on large goal models, exhibiting that in a simulation environment, the parallel reasoning process offers significant performance improvement over a sequential one.                </td>

                     Control-system robustness verification with respect to implementation aspects lacks automated verification approaches for checking stability and performance of uncertain control systems, when considering finite word-length (FWL) effects. Here we describe and evaluate novel verification procedures for digital systems with uncertainties, based on software model checking and satisfiability modulo theories, named as DSVerifier v2.0, which is able to check robust stability of closed-loop control systems with respect to FWL effects. In particular, we describe our verification algorithms to check for limit-cycle oscillations (LCOs), output quantization error, and robust non-fragile stability on common closed-loop associations of digital control systems (i.e., series and feedback). DSVerifier v2.0 model checks new properties of closed-loop systems (e.g., LCO), including stability and output quantization error for uncertain plant models, and considers unknown parameters and FWL effects. Experimental results over a large set of benchmarks show that 35%, 34%, and 41% of success can be reached for stability, LCO, and output quantization error verification procedures, respectively, for a set of 396 closed-loop control system implementations and realizations.                </td>

                     This paper is concerned with the security control problem for a class of Markov jump systems subject to false data injection attack and incomplete transition rates. An on-line estimation strategy is provided for the time-variant and unknown cyber-attack modes. And then, an adaptive sliding mode controller is synthesized with different robust terms for different modes to guarantee the reachability of the specified sliding surface. Moreover, the sufficient conditions for the stability of the closed-loop systems are derived. Finally, it is shown from simulation results that the effect of both false data injection attack and incomplete TRs can be effectively attenuated by the present adaptive SMC method.                </td>

                     Localization underwater has been known to be challenging due to the limited accessibility of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to obtain absolute positions. This becomes more severe in the under-ice environment since the ocean surface is covered with ice, making it more difficult to access GPS or to deploy localization infrastructure. In this paper, a novel solution that minimizes localization uncertainty and communication overhead of under-ice Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is proposed. Existing underwater localization solutions generally rely on reference nodes at ocean surface or on localization infrastructure to calculate positions, and they are not able to estimate the localization uncertainty, which may lead to the increase of localization error. In contrast, using the notion of external uncertainty (i.e., the position uncertainty as seen by others), our solution can characterize an AUV’s position with a probability model. This model is further used to estimate the uncertainty associated with our proposed localization techniques. Based on this uncertainty estimate, we further propose algorithms to minimize localization uncertainty and communication overhead. Our solution is emulated and compared against existing solutions, showing improved performance.                </td>

                     Recently there has been increasing engineering activity in the deployment of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Different types of AUVs are being used for applications ranging from ocean exploration to coastal tactical surveillance. These AUVs generally follow a predictable trajectory specified by the mission requirements. Inaccuracies in models for deriving position estimates and the drift caused by ocean currents, however, lead to uncertainty when estimating an AUV’s position. In this article, two forms of position uncertainty – internal and external – are studied, which are the position uncertainty associated with a particular AUV as seen by itself and that as seen by others, respectively. Then, a statistical model to estimate the internal uncertainty for a general AUV is proposed. Based on this model, a novel mathematical framework using Unscented Kalman Filtering is developed to estimate the external uncertainty. Finally, the benefits of this framework for several location-sensitive applications are shown via emulations.                </td>

                     With the significant advancements in Information and Communications Technology (ICT), cloud based applications provide a novel approach to access applications which are not installed on the local computers. The integration of cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) indicated a bright future of the Internet. In this paper, a new architecture of cloud computing—Model as a Service (MaaS) is proposed. The feasibility of the proposed architecture is proved by implementing a groundwater model on cloud as a case study. The groundwater model is established using MODFLOW for the middle reach of the Heihe River Basin (HRB). The model is calibrated using in situ observation to ensure capability of simulating the groundwater process with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.70 m and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.64. The parameter uncertainties of the groundwater model are analyzed by sequential data assimilation algorithms (PF, Particle Filter; EnKF, Ensemble Kalman Filter) in a synthetic case. The results show that the parameter uncertainties are effectively reduced by incorporating observed information recursively. A comparison between PF and EnKF indicate that the results from PF are slightly better than those from EnKF. The integration shows a bright future for simulating the groundwater system in real-time. This study provides a flexible and effective approach for analyzing the uncertainties and time variant properties of the parameters and the proposed architecture of cloud computing provides a novel approach for the researchers and decision-makers to construct numerical models and follow-up researches.                </td>

                     Modern automotive vehicles represent one category of CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems) that are inherently time- and safety-critical. To justify the actions for quality-of-service adaptation and safety assurance, it is fundamental to perceive the uncertainties of system components in operation, which are caused by emergent properties, design or operation anomalies. From an industrial point of view, a further challenge is related to the usages of generic purpose COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) components, which are separately developed and evolved, often not sufficiently verified and validated for specific automotive contexts. While introducing additional uncertainties in regard to the overall system performance and safety, the adoption of COTS components constitutes a necessary means for effective product evolution and innovation. Accordingly, we propose in this paper a novel approach that aims to enable advanced operation monitoring and self-assessment in regard to operational uncertainties and thereby automated performance and safety awareness. The emphasis is on the integration of several modeling technologies, including the domain-specific modeling framework EAST-ADL, the A-G contract theory and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In particular, we also present some initial concepts in regard to the usage performance and safety awareness for quality-of-service adaptation and dynamic risk mitigation.                </td>

                     Predicting traffic flow is one of the fundamental needs to comfortable travel, but this task is challenging in vehicular cyber–physical systems because of ever-increasing uncertain traffic big data. Although deep-learning (DL) methods with outstanding performance recently have become popular, most existing DL models for traffic flow prediction are fully deterministic and shed no light on data uncertainty. In this study, a novel fuzzy deep-learning approach called FDCN is proposed for predicting citywide traffic flow. This approach is built on the fuzzy theory and the deep residual network model. Our key idea is to introduce the fuzzy representation into the DL model to lessen the impact of data uncertainty. A model of fuzzy deep convolutional network is established to improve traffic flow prediction while investigating the spatial and temporal correlation of traffic flow. We further propose pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that efficiently learn parameters of the FDCN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a fuzzy DL approach has been applied to represent traffic features for traffic flow prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach to traffic flow prediction has superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.                </td>

                     This keynote talk and paper intend to motivate research projects that investigate novel ways to model, analyze, and mitigate uncertainty arising in three different aspects of the cyber-physical systems. First, uncertainty about the physical environment can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes catastrophic, results as the system tries to adapt to unanticipated or poorly-understood environmental conditions. Second, uncertainty in the cyber environment can have lead to unexpected and adverse effects, including not only performance impacts (load, traffic, etc.) but also potential threats or overt attacks. Finally, uncertainty can exist with the components themselves and how they interact upon reconfiguration, including unexpected and unwanted feature interactions. Each of these sources of uncertainty can potentially be identified at different stages, respectively run time, design time, and requirements, but their mitigation might be done at the same or a different stage. Based on the related literature and our preliminary investigations, we argue that the following three overarching techniques are essential and warrant further research to provide enabling technologies to address uncertainty at all three stages: model-based development, assurance, and dynamic adaptation. Furthermore, we posit that in order to go beyond incremental improvements to current software engineering techniques, we need to leverage, extend, and integrate techniques from other disciplines.                </td>

                     Long-lived, non-stop cyber-physical systems (CPS) are subject to evolutionary changes that can undermine the guarantees of schedulability that were verified at the time of deployment. At the same time, knowledge gleamed from extended periods of execution can be exploited to reduce the uncertainties that were inevitably presented in the system models that are used to define the temporal behaviours of the control tasks. In this paper we utilise this knowledge and present an adaptation method that actively extends the period of control tasks at run-time based on historical measurements. This can lead to lower power consumption or to the accommodation of increased computation resource demands from other components of the CPS. The method relies on online monitoring and model-based prediction to degrade control performance while having a minimal and acceptable impact on ongoing operations. Cloud-based computing is used to facilitate decision making and offload the local computation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method through control-scheduling co-simulation.                </td>

                    Internet of Things is characterized by a lot of resources connected to the Internet, many simultaneously requesting and providing services. The adequate selection of resources that best meets the demands of users with a broad range of options has been a relevant and current research challenge. Based on the non-functional parameters of QoS, it plays a significant role in the ranking of these resources according to the services they offer. This work presents a proposal to classify and select the most appropriate resource to the client's request, using fuzzy logic to treat uncertainties in the definition of ideal weights for QoS attributes. It also proposes to add fuzzy logic in the pre-classification of resources, to reduce the computational cost generated by MCDA algorithms. The accuracy of the proposed model in the pre-classification of the best resources is presented, and the results obtained are promising and indicate the continuity of the research.

                The Internet of Things (IoT) is characterized by a broad range of resources connected to the Internet, requesting and providing services simultaneously. Given this scenario, suitably selecting the resources that best meet users’ demands has been a relevant and current research challenge. Based on the non-functional parameters of Quality of Service (QoS), IoT plays an important role in the ranking of these resources according to the offered services. This paper presents a proposal to classify and select the most appropriate resource for the client’s request, applying fuzzy logic to address uncertainties in the definition of ideal weights for QoS attributes, and aggregating machine learning to the pre-classification of EXEHDA middleware resources, in order to reduce the computational cost generated by MCDA algorithms. As the main contribution, the pre-classification of new resources of the EXEHDA-RR is presented. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed model.

            This paper considers a synthetic counter-measure, combining transmission scheduling and defensive deception, to defend against jamming attacks in remote state estimation. In the setup studied, an attacker sabotages packet transmissions from a sensor to a remote estimator by congesting the communication channel between them. In order to efficiently degrade the estimation accuracy, the intelligent attacker tailors its jamming strategy by reacting to the real-time information it collects. In response to the jamming attacks, the sensor with a long-term goal will select the transmission power level at each stage. In addition, by modifying the real-time information intentionally, the sensor creates asymmetric uncertainty to mislead the attacker and thus mitigate attacks. Considering the dynamic nature of the process, we model the strategic interaction between the sensor and the attacker by a general stochastic game with asymmetric information structure. To obtain stationary optimal strategies for each player, we convert this game into a belief-based dynamic game and analyze the existence of its optimal solution. For a tractable implementation, we present an algorithm that finds equilibrium strategies based on multi-agent reinforcement learning for symmetric-information stochastic games. Numerical examples illustrate properties of the proposed algorithm.

            As a new intelligent manufacturing model, the Internet of Manufacturing Things (IOMT) based on the Internet of Things technology has a large amount of random, fuzzy, and uncertain information, which makes the optimization of manufacturing services face challenges. On the basis of fully considering the uncertain factors in the process of manufacturing service, a quality of service (QoS) optimization method based on mixed information axioms is proposed to solve the optimization problem of manufacturing service in the IOMT environment. The mixed uncertainty model is expounded with random variables to express the range of system and fuzzy variables to describe the design range. In order to select the best resource or sort, the fuzzy mathematics and the axiomatic theory of axiomatic design theory are combined to evaluate the coexistence of ambiguity and randomness of the QoS. Finally, the process of treatment and optimization in practical application by taking the example of a hydraulic pump product seeking service through the civil aircraft IOMT service platform is described. This example is given out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with the traditional information axiom method, and this method extends the application scope of traditional information axioms.

            The ever-growing complexity of software systems coupled with their stringent availability requirements are challenging the manual management of software after its deployment. This has motivated the development of self-adaptive software systems. Self-adaptation endows a software system with the ability to satisfy certain objectives by automatically modifying its behavior at runtime. While many promising approaches for the construction of self-adaptive software systems have been developed, the majority of them ignore the uncertainty underlying the adaptation. This has been one of the key inhibitors to widespread adoption of self-adaption techniques in risk-averse real-world applications. Uncertainty in this setting is a vaguely understood term. In this paper, we characterize the sources of uncertainty in self-adaptive software system, and demonstrate its impact on the system’s ability to satisfy its objectives. We then provide an alternative notion of optimality that explicitly incorporates the uncertainty underlying the knowledge (models) used for decision making. We discuss the state-of-the-art for dealing with uncertainty in this setting, and conclude with a set of challenges, which provide a road map for future research.

            This paper presents a stochastic programming approach, using a risk measure defined by conditional value-at-risk, for trading solar energy in a market environment under uncertainty. Uncertainties on electricity price and solar irradiation are considered through a set of scenarios computed by simulation and scenario-reduction. The short-term operation problem of a concentrating solar power plant is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, which allows modelling the discrete status of the plant. To improve the operational productivity of the plant during the non-insulation periods, energy storage systems are considered. The goal is to obtain the optimal operation planning that maximizes the total expected profits while evaluating trading risks. For risk evaluation, the conditional value-at-risk is used to maximize the expected profits of the least profitable scenarios. A case study is used to illustrate the usefulness and the proficiency of the proposed approach.

            Pervasive information consumers in open, loosely-coupled systems, such as in Internet of Things and crowd-sensing environment, will rely more and more often on streaming information from sensory sources with whom they have only ephemeral, transient relationships. In such settings, information uncertainties arise as the trustworthiness of the sources and their information become questionable. It is thus necessary to quantify the quality of inferences made with such information to aid more informed and effective decision making and action taking. One of the aspects of trust assessment systems is to provide for such quality metrics, however, these systems have been traditionally applied in static situations. In this paper, we introduce TAF, a trust assessment framework for streaming information that leverages the rich toolkit of subjective logic operators to estimate the quality of said inferences under information uncertainty. We present the system architecture, describe its components and provide some preliminary quality results for the framework.        </td>

            Most automated systems operate in uncertain or adversarial conditions, and have to be capable of reliably reacting to changes in the environment. The focus of this paper is on automatically synthesizing reactive controllers for cyber-physical systems subject to signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. We build on recent work that encodes STL specifications as mixed integer linear constraints on the variables of a discrete-time model of the system and environment dynamics. To obtain a reactive controller, we present solutions to the worst-case model predictive control (MPC) problem using a suite of mixed integer linear programming techniques. We demonstrate the comparative effectiveness of several existing worst-case MPC techniques, when applied to the problem of control subject to temporal logic specifications; our empirical results emphasize the need to develop specialized solutions for this domain.

            Trajectory generation is at the heart of an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Given a navigation context, the UAV has to conceive a trajectory that fulfills its mission goal while avoiding collisions with obstacles and surrounding traffic. This intended trajectory is an idealization of the various actual physical trajectories that the UAV may perform during flight. The validation of actual physical trajectories with respect to their intended counterparts is challenging due to the interaction over time of several uncontrolled factors such as the environmental conditions, measurement errors and the cyber-physical components of the UAV. For this reason, the most common validation technique for trajectory generators is flight simulation, which is not exhaustive and thus cannot prove the actual absence of collisions.

            This paper presents a preliminary formal framework to reason about the safety of UAV trajectories with respect to static-obstacle collision avoidance taking account of the uncertainties derived from uncontrolled factors. The proposed framework was formally verified in a mechanical theorem prover. Its application as an oracle for black-box testing validation of trajectory generators is also proposed. Such testing strategy would allow the safety evaluation of trajectories while removing the need for simulation procedures, thus reducing the cost of the validation process.

This dynamic nature of customer requirements has been described as a constantly moving target, thus presenting a significant challenge for several aspects of product development. To deal with this constant and sometimes unpredictable product evolution, cyber physical production systems (CPPS) that employ condition monitoring, self-awareness and reconfigurability principles, have to be designed and implemented. This research contributes a CPPS design approach that proactively provides the required CPPS design knowledge. This approach aims to minimise or avoids future consequences and disruptions on the CPPS. This knowledge needs to be provided at the right time whilst not being intrusive to the production system designer’s cognitive activity. To effectively deal with the complexity of the cyber physical production system design activity with a manual method would lead to a time consuming, and complex support tool which is hard to implement, and difficult to use. The CPPS design approach has therefore been implemented in a prototype digital factory tool. This paper describes in detail the system requirements and system architecture for this tool. In order to establish the effectiveness of the proposed approach for designing cyber physical production systems, the prototype digital factory tool has been evaluated with a case study and a number of semi-structured interviews with both industrial and scientific stakeholders. The encouraging results obtained from this research evaluation have shown that such an approach for supporting the CPPS design activity makes stakeholders aware of their decision consequences and is useful in practice. This result can lead the way for the development and integration of such knowledge-based decision-making approaches within state-of-the-art digital factory and Computer Aided Engineering Design (CAED) tools.

               	   	Industry 4.0 is widely accepted in manufacturing industry since it guides a novel and promising production paradigm. A new characteristic in Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems is that the applications of advanced intelligent machines which have communication, self-optimization and self-training behaviors. Based on this new change, this study investigates a flow-shop scheduling problem under the consideration of multiple objectives, time-dependent processing time and uncertainty. A mixed integer programming model is formulated for this problem, and a fireworks algorithm is developed where some special strategies are designed, e.g., explosion sparks procedure and selection solution procedure. Simulation experiments on a set of test problems are carried out, and the experimental results demonstrate that the model and proposed algorithm can achieve a satisfactory performance by comparing with three state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms.

A fully distributed adaptive leaderless consensus control strategy is proposed to deal with the sensor and actuator attacks. Compared with existing results in which the model considered is simple, a strict-feedback nonlinear system is considered in this paper, which makes the problem more challenging. It is shown that all closed-loop signals are uniformly bounded and asymptotic output consensus is achieved in presence of sensor and actuator attacks. Simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.

               	   	Power cyber-physical systems (PCPSs) are becoming increasingly complex and diverse, benefitting from all aspects of societal issues. A PCPS is a next-generation system that is a tight conjunction of computation, communication, control, and power systems. The integration of Internet of Things and PCPS generates a novel energy system, the Internet of Energy, which is the future of the energy system. In the same way, the connection of bulk components and the extensive communications among them has brought many insecurities, uncertainties, and security challenges. Thus, a study of the analysis and synthesis of the reliability and security of PCPS is presented in this paper. By considering the unsafe uncertainties, models are formulated for a general cyber-attack, and a double-loop architecture for security defense is designed. According to this framework, security control scenarios are obtained from the character of each kind of cyber-attack. Finally, a separately excited dc motor with uncertainty is used as an example to demonstrate the problem.

               	   	Programming embedded and cyber-physical systems requires attention not only to functional behavior and correctness, but also to non-functional aspects and specifically timing and performance. A structured, compositional, model-based approach based on stepwise refinement and abstraction techniques can support the development process, increase its quality and reduce development time through automation of synthesis, analysis or verification. Toward this, we introduce a theory of timed actors whose notion of refinement is based on the principle of worst-case design that permeates the world of performance-critical systems. This is in contrast with the classical behavioral and functional refinements based on restricting sets of behaviors. Our refinement allows time-deterministic abstractions to be made of time-non-deterministic systems, improving efficiency and reducing complexity of formal analysis. We show how our theory relates to, and can be used to reconcile existing time and performance models and their established theories.

               	   	This article is a tutorial on how to achieve software evolution and adaptation in a dependable manner, by systematically applying formal modelling and verification. It shows how software can be designed upfront to tolerate different sources of uncertainty that cause continuous future changes. If possible changes can be predicted, and their occurrence can be detected, it is possible to design the software to be self-adaptable. Otherwise, continuous evolution has to be supported and continuous flow into operation has to be ensured. In cases where systems are designed to be continuously running, it is necessary to support safe continuous software deployment that guarantees correct operation in the presence of dynamic reconfigurations. The approaches we survey here have been mainly developed in the context of the SMScom project, funded by the European Commission –Programme IDEAS-ERC (http://erc-smscom.dei.polimi.it/.) – and lead by the author. It is argued that these approaches fit well the current agile methods for development and operations that are popularized as DevOps.

               	   	The cyber-physical systems of Industry 4.0 are expected to generate vast amount of in-process data and revolutionise the way data, knowledge and wisdom is captured and reused in manufacturing industries. The goal is to increase profits by dramatically reducing the occurrence of unexpected process results and waste. ISO9001:2015 defines risk as effect of uncertainty. In the 7Epsilon context, the risk is defined as effect of uncertainty on expected results. The paper proposes a novel algorithm to embed risk based thinking in quantifying uncertainty in manufacturing operations during the tolerance synthesis process. This method uses penalty functions to mathematically represent deviation from expected results and solves the tolerance synthesis problem by proposing a quantile regression tree approach. The latter involves non parametric estimation of conditional quantiles of a response variable from in-process data and allows process engineers to discover and visualise optimal ranges that are associated with quality improvements. In order to quantify uncertainty and predict process robustness, a probabilistic approach, based on the likelihood ratio test with bootstrapping, is proposed which uses smoothed probability estimation of conditional probabilities. The mathematical formulation presented in this paper will allow organisations to extend Six Sigma process improvement principles in the Industry 4.0 context and implement the 7 steps of 7Epsilon in order to satisfy the requirements of clauses 6.1 and 7.1.6 of the ISO9001:2015 and the aerospace AS9100:2016 quality standard.

                            This paper deals with the problem of optimal bidding in a day-ahead market of electricity for a power producer having joint operation of wind with photovoltaic power systems and storage of energy. Uncertainty, not only on electricity market prices, but also on wind and photovoltaic powers, has to be faced in order to achieve optimal bidding. The problem is viewed as a sort of a two-stage stochastic optimization problem formulated by mix-integer linear programming. A case study with data from the Iberian Peninsula is presented and a comparison between joint and disjoint operations is discussed, allowing concluding that the joint operation attenuates the economic impact of disjoint operation volatility.

                            Uncertainty is one of the most critical aspects that affect the quality of Big Data management and mining methods. Clustering uncertain data has traditionally focused on data coming from location- based services, sensor networks, or error-prone laboratory experiments. In this work we study for the first time the impact of clustering uncertain data on a novel context consisting in visiting styles in an art exhibition. We consider a dataset derived from the interaction of visitors of a museum with a complex Internet of Things (IoT) framework. We model this data as a set of uncertain objects, and cluster them by employing the well-established UK-medoids algorithm. Results show that clustering accuracy is positively impacted when data uncertainty is taken into account.

                        Context: Software Fuzzy Self-Adaptation (SFSA) is a fuzzy control-based software self-adaptation paradigm proposed to deal with the fuzzy uncertainty existing in self-adaptive software. However, as many software engineers lack fuzzy control knowledge, it is difficult for them to design and model this kind of fuzzy self-adaptive software (F-SAS). Therefore, efficient and effective modeling technologies and tools are needed for the SFSA framework.
                        Objective: This paper aims to identify modeling requirements of F-SAS and to provide a modeling framework to specify, design and model F-SAS systems. Such a framework can simplify modeling process of F-SAS and improve the accessibility of software engineers to the SFSA paradigm.
                        Method: This study proposes a modeling framework called Fuzzy self-Adaptation ModEling (FAME). By extending UML, FAME creates three types of modeling views. An analysis view called Fuzzy Case Diagram is created to specify the fuzzy self-adaptation goal and the realization processes of this goal. A structure view called Fuzzy Class Diagram is created to describe the fuzzy concepts and structural characteristics of F-SAS. A behavior view called Fuzzy Sequence Diagram is created to depict the dynamic behaviors of the F-SAS systems. The framework is implemented as a plug-in of Enterprise Architect.
                        Results: We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach by carrying out a subject-based empirical evaluation. The results show that FAME framework can improve modeling quality of F-SAS systems by 44.38% and shorten modeling time of F-SAS systems by 38.41% in comparison with traditional UML. Thus, FAME can considerably ease the modeling process of F-SAS systems.
                        Conclusion: FAME framework incorporates the SFSA concepts into standard UML. Therefore, it provides a direct support to model SFSA characteristics and improves the accessibility of software engineers to the SFSA paradigm. Furthermore, it behaves a good example and provides good references for modeling domain-specific software systems.

                       This paper presents a sound and complete fault detection approach for cyber–physical systems represented by hidden-mode switched affine models with time varying parametric uncertainty. The fault detection approach builds upon techniques from model invalidation. In particular, a set-membership approach is taken where the noisy input–output data is compared to the set of behaviors of a nominal model. As we show, this set-membership check can be reduced to the feasibility of a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which can be solved efficiently by leveraging the state-of-the-art MILP solvers. In the second part of the paper, given a system model and a fault model, the concept of -detectability is introduced. If a pair of system and fault models satisfies -detectability property for a finite , this allows the model invalidation algorithm to be implemented in a receding horizon manner, without compromising detection guarantees. In addition, the concept of weak-detectability is introduced which extends the proposed approach to a more expressive class of fault models that capture language constraints on the mode sequences. Finally, the efficiency of the approach is illustrated with numerical examples motivated by smart building radiant systems.

                        Event processing follows a decoupled model of interaction in space, time, and synchronization. However, another dimension of semantic coupling also exists and poses a challenge to the scalability of event processing systems in highly semantically heterogeneous and dynamic environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Current state-of-the-art approaches of content-based and concept-based event systems require a significant agreement between event producers and consumers on event schema or an external conceptual model of event semantics. Thus, they do not address the semantic coupling issue. This article proposes an approach where participants only agree on a distributional statistical model of semantics represented in a corpus of text to derive semantic similarity and relatedness. It also proposes an approximate model for relaxing the semantic coupling dimension via an approximation-enabled rule language and an approximate event matcher. The model is formalized as an ensemble of semantic and top-k matchers along with a probability model for uncertainty management. The model has been empirically validated on large sets of events and subscriptions synthesized from real-world smart city and energy management systems. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves more than 95% F1Score of effectiveness and thousands of events/sec of throughput for medium degrees of approximation while not requiring users to have complete prior knowledge of event semantics. In semantically loosely-coupled environments, one approximate subscription can compensate for hundreds of exact subscriptions to cover all possibilities in environments which require complete prior knowledge of event semantics. Results indicate that approximate semantic event processing could play a promising role in the IoT middleware layer.

                            Smart grid is a so-called “cyber-power system” because the cyber systems (control/monitoring/protection, and communication networks) are integrated to power systems in it. The less effort has been devoted in literature to reliability evaluation based on direct cyber-power Interdependencies (DCPIs) in widespread presence of distributed generations (DGs) and charging load of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as supply side uncertainties and demand side ones. The consideration of uncertainty regarding the PHEVs in addition to other uncertain aspects inside the DCPIs is one of the most important contributions of this paper. In addition, the sensitivity analysis of reliability versus the variation of failures in power and cyber elements is essentially analyzed. The introduced method is applied to two realistic case studies. The test results infer that the DCPI-based reliability evaluation of smart grids including DGs and PHEVs is achievable through use of the proposed method. Because of using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), it is possible to extend the proposed method by integration of future uncertain and stochastic subjects without any limit. Further, the test results illustrate that the communication failures as direct network-element interdependencies (DNEI) is more important than direct element-element interdependencies (DEEI). The numerical results also imply that the risk level due to DCPIs increases due to inappropriate cyber network configurations.

                            In the current era of big data, huge volumes of a wide variety of valuable data of different veracity (e.g., uncertain data) can be easily collected and generated from a broad range of data sources (e.g., social networking sites) at a high velocity in various real-life applications. Many traditional data management and analytic approaches may not be suitable for handling the big data due to their well-known 5V’s characteristics. In this paper, we present a cognitive-based system for social network analysis. Our system supports information discovery of interesting social patterns from big uncertain social networks—which are represented in the form of key-value pairs—capturing the perceived likelihood of the linkages among the social entities in the network.

                        A self-adaptive cyber-physical system (SACPS) can adjust its behavior and configurations at runtime in response to varying requirements obtained from the system and the environment. With the increasing use of the SACPS in different application domains, such variations are becoming more common. Users today expect the SACPS to guarantee its functional and timing behavior even in adverse environmental situations. However, uncertainties in the SACPS environment impose challenges on assuring the runtime behavior during system design.
                       Software product line engineering (SPLE) is considered as a useful technique for handling varying requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for assuring the runtime behavior of the SACPS by applying an SPLE technique such as feature modeling. By representing the feature-based model at design time, we characterize the possible adaptation requirements to reusable configurations. The proposed approach aims to model two dynamic variability dimensions: 1) environment variability that describes the conditions under which the SACPS must adapt, and 2) structural variability, that defines the resulting architectural configurations. To validate our approach, the experimental analysis is performed using two case studies: 1) a traffic monitoring SACPS and 2) an automotive SACPS. We demonstrate that the proposed feature-based modeling approach can be used to achieve adaptivity which allows the SACPS to assure functional (defining execution of the correct set of adaptive tasks) and non-functional (defining execution of SACPS in the expected mode) correctness at runtime. The experimental results show that the feature-based SACPS demonstrates significant improvement in terms of self-configuration time, self-adaptation time and scalability with less probability of failure in different environmental situations.

							This paper develops a sampled-data (SD) controller for uncertain multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, possibly with non-minimum phase zeros, using the L1 adaptive control architecture. The proposed controller compensates for disturbances and uncertainties within the bandwidth of a low-pass filter. Sufficient conditions for robust stability are obtained for the closed-loop system with SD controller, where the input/output signals are held constant over a sampling period. It is shown that the hybrid closed-loop system can recover the performance of a continuous-time reference system as the sampling time of the SD controller tends to zero. Simulation examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings.

							Medical cyber-physical systems, such as the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), require evaluation of safety and efficacy in the context of a patient population in a clinical trial. Advances in computer modeling and simulation allow for generation of a simulated cohort or virtual cohort which mimics a patient population and can be used as a source of prior information. A major obstacle to acceptance of simulation results as a source of prior information is the lack of a framework for explicitly modeling sources of uncertainty in simulation results and quantifying the effect on trial outcomes.In this work, we formulate the Computer-Aided Clinical Trial (CACT) within a Bayesian statistical framework allowing explicit modeling of assumptions and utilization of simulation results at all stages of a clinical trial. To quantify the robustness of the CACT outcome with respect to a simulation assumption, we define δ-robustness as the minimum perturbation of the base prior distribution resulting in a change of the CACT outcome and provide a method to estimate the δ-robustness.We demonstrate the utility of the framework and how the results of δ-robustness evaluation can be utilized at various stages of a clinical trial through an application to the Rhythm ID Goes Head-to-head Trial (RIGHT), which was a comparative evaluation of the safety and efficacy of specific software algorithms across different implantable cardiac devices. Finally, we introduce a hardware interface that allows for direct interaction with the physical device in order to validate and confirm the results of a CACT for implantable cardiac devices.

							The use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and devices is on a sharp rise with the help of infrastructures like 5G cellular networks. However, with this swift expansion come major challenges such as management of the vast data collected by these IoT devices. In the paper, we propose a method which takes advantage of fuzzy similarity to significantly simplify the big data analysis and management for human operators and machines. A use case in the area of smart buildings was utilized to illustrate its potential application. A comparison is made between the ideal situation and the data collected from an office room. The considered environmental factors in this research are temperature, humidity, and workplace lighting and then the collected data was utilized to make triangular fuzzy numbers and after that, we compare them with an efficient fuzzy similarity measure. In addition to data summarization and abstraction, this method also protects the main information from inaccuracy. The advantage of the fuzzy controlling system is its aptitude to deal with nonlinearities and uncertainties.

							With the emergence of the Internet of Things and smart devices, smart homes are becoming more and more popular. The main goal of this study is to implement an event driven system in a smart home and to extract meaningful information from the raw data collected by the deployed sensors using Complex Event Processing (CEP). These high-level events can then be used by multiple smart home applications in particular situation identification. However, in real life scenarios, low-level events are generally uncertain. In fact, an event may be outdated, inaccurate, imprecise or in contradiction with another one. This can lead to misinterpretation from CEP and the associated applications. To overcome these weaknesses, in this paper, we propose a Fuzzy Semantic Complex Event Processing (FSCEP) model which can represent and reason with events by including domain knowledge and integrating fuzzy logic. It handles multiple dimensions of uncertainty, namely freshness, accuracy, precision and contradiction. FSCEP has been implemented and compared with a well known CEP. The results show how some ambiguities are solved.

							Cyber-physical systems are often hybrid consisting of both discrete and continuous subsystems. The continuous dynamics in cyber-physical systems could be noisy and the environment in which these stochastic hybrid systems operate can also be uncertain. We focus on multimodal hybrid systems in which the switching from one mode to another is determined by a schedule and the optimal finite horizon control problem is to discover the switching schedule as well as the control inputs to be applied in each mode such that some cost metric is minimized over the given horizon. We consider discrete-time control in this paper. We present a two step approach to solve this problem with respect to convex cost objectives and probabilistic safety properties. Our approach uses a combination of sample average approximation and convex programming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on case studies from temperature-control in buildings and motion planning.

							Autonomous vehicles have found wide-ranging adoption in aerospace, terrestrial as well as marine use. These systems often operate in uncertain environments and in the presence of noisy sensors, and use machine learning and statistical sensor fusion algorithms to form an internal model of the world that is inherently probabilistic. Autonomous vehicles need to operate using this uncertain world-model, and hence, their correctness cannot be deterministically specified. Even once probabilistic correctness is specified, proving that an autonomous vehicle will operate correctly is a challenging problem. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a correct-by-synthesis approach to autonomous vehicle control. We propose a probabilistic extension of temporal logic, named Chance Constrained Temporal Logic (C2TL), that can be used to specify correctness requirements in presence of uncertainty. C2TL extends temporal logic by including chance constraints as predicates in the formula which allows modeling of perception uncertainty while retaining its ease of reasoning. We present a novel automated synthesis technique that compiles C2TL specification into mixed integer constraints, and uses second-order (quadratic) cone programming to synthesize optimal control of autonomous vehicles subject to the C2TL specification. We also present a risk distribution approach that enables synthesis of plans with lower cost without increasing the overall risk. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a diverse set of illustrative examples.

					[Context/ Motivation] A smart device is a software-intensive system that operates autonomously and interacts to some degree with other systems over wireless connections. Such systems are often faced with uncertainty in the environment. Runtime representations of requirements have recently gained more interested to deal with this challenge and the term requirements at runtime has been established. Runtime representations of requirements support reasoning about the requirements at runtime and adapting the configuration of a system according to changes in the environment. [Questions/Problems] The research question is how the results of runtime monitoring of requirements and the system’s decisions about changes in the configuration are communicated back to the requirements engineer to better understand the environment. There is a gap between the written requirements document and the dynamic requirements model inside the system. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that a requirements document are mostly informal while the dynamic requirements model is formal. [Principal ideas/results] This paper introduces an approach to bridge the gap between development time and runtime representations of requirements in order to keep them consistent and to facilitate better understanding. We propose to weave the feedback from the runtime system into requirements documents using a domain-specific language that largely retain the informal nature of requirements. An annotated requirements document helps get a better understanding of the system’s actual behavior in a given environment. The approach is implemented using mbeddr, a novel set of domain-specific languages for developing embedded systems, and illustrated using a running example.

						When creating the Internet of Things and Smart Machines, the RULES ENGINE pattern is developed. The tasks that Rules Engine solves in real time are characterized by large amounts of data from various sensors. To account for uncertainty, a new model of Smart Rules Engine is proposed with a two-step inference engine, including an engine of abstraction from data. A model based on quantitative, definitive and generalization type of abstraction is considered. It is shown that the proposed model solves the problem of the bridge between natural language, as a carrier of the concept's meaning, and data from sensors, as carriers of the perception. A model for presenting a prototype is given in which incomplete knowledge, expert's uncertainty in the definition of the concept and aging of data are taken into account. The prototype and data model representation and the abstraction engine are built based on fuzzy L-R numbers and arithmetic operations on them. The preliminary step of abstraction from the data, besides taking into account the uncertainty of a different nature, significantly reduces the dimension of the fuzzy inference space. A comparison of the two-step fuzzy inference engine with the traditional inference engine Fuzzy Logic System Type-1 is given using the example of a wheeled robot making the decision to safely cross an unregulated crossroad.

						In recent years, expectations for large-scale wireless sensor networks have been rapidly increased due to miniaturization, cost reduction, reduction in power consumption of wireless sensor devices, and the emergence of wireless sensor network applications such as IoT (Internet Of Things). However, in addition to the uncertainty inherent in wireless sensor networks, due to the uncertainty caused by the expansion of wireless sensor networks, it is not easy to realize a highly efficient and reliable large-scale wireless sensor network. The uncertainty of wireless sensor networks is classified into three types: the uncertainty of nodes such as sensor nodes and sink nodes, the uncertainty of wireless communication links among nodes, and the uncertainty of traffic transferred over the wireless sensor network. In this paper, as a wireless communication standard, we focus on IEEE 802.15.4, which is designed for short-range wireless networks called PANs (Personal Area Networks), and analyze large-scale wireless sensor networks using fluid approximation. Specifically, IEEE 802.15.4 large-scale wireless sensor networks are analyzed by extending the modeling approach for generic CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) wireless networks. Moreover, our analysis makes it possible to probabilistically model temporal fluctuation of wireless communication ranges of nodes as network uncertainty. As a result, our analysis clarifies the effect of link uncertainty on the average message delivery delay in wireless sensor networks.

						Program variables used in robotic and cyber-physical systems often have implicit physical units that cannot be determined from their variable types. Inferring an abstract physical unit type for variables and checking their physical unit type consistency is of particular importance for validating the correctness of such systems. For instance, a variable with the unit of ‘meter’ should not be assigned to another variable with the unit of ‘degree-per-second’. Existing solutions have various limitations such as requiring developers to annotate variables with physical units and only handling variables that are directly or transitively used in popular robotic libraries with known physical unit information. We observe that there are a lot of physical unit hints in these softwares such as variable names and specific forms of expressions. These hints have uncertainty as developers may not respect conventions. We propose to model them with probability distributions and conduct probabilistic inference. At the end, our technique produces a unit distribution for each variable. Unit inconsistencies can then be detected using the highly probable unit assignments. Experimental results on 30 programs show that our technique can infer units for 159.3% more variables compared to the state-of-the-art with more than 88.7% true positives, and inconsistencies detection on 90 programs shows that our technique reports 103.3% more inconsistencies with 85.3% true positives.

For these reasons, risk management in IoT could be improved by application of fuzzy data processing. The paper considers the main approaches to the construction of intelligent methods and algorithms of information security risk assessment and management for IoT. Mathematical models for security risk assessment in IoT are proposed and investigated. In relation to the concept of multi-agent network control, the Mamdani fuzzy inference procedures for risk assessment and management are developed. Procedures for fuzzy clustering, classification and ranking of security threats are outlined. The experimental results show high stability of the developed security risks management algorithms to uncertainties of input variables.

               	   		The integration of physical systems through computing and networking has become pervasive, a trend now known as cyber-physical systems (CPS). Functionality in CPS emerges from the interaction of networked computational and physical objects. System design and integration are particularly challenging because fundamentally different physical and computational design concerns intersect. The impact of these interactions is the loss of compositionality which creates tremendous challenges. The key idea in this article is to use passivity for decoupling the control design of networked systems from uncertainties such as time delays and packet loss, thus providing a fundamental simplification strategy that limits the complexity of interactions. The main contribution is the application of the approach to an experimental case study of a networked multi-robot system. We present a networked control architecture that ensures the overall system remains stable in spite of implementation uncertainties such as network delays and data dropouts, focusing on the technical details required for the implementation. We describe a prototype domain-specific modeling language and automated code generation tools for the design of networked control systems on top of passivity that facilitate effective system configuration, deployment, and testing. Finally, we present experimental evaluation results that show decoupling of interlayer interactions.

               	   		Medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) combine independent devices at runtime in order to render new patient monitoring/control functionalities, such as physiological closed loops for controlling drug infusion and optimization of alarms. MCPS and their relevant system contexts are highly variable, which detrimentally affects the application of established safety assurance methodologies. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on dynamic risk assessment and control for MCPS. During runtime, information regarding the safety properties of the constituent systems, relevant information about the patient’s characteristics, as well as other relevant context information is utilized to dynamically and continuously optimize the system performance while guaranteeing an acceptable level of safety. We evaluated our approach by means of a patient-controlled analgesia proof-of-concept simulation and sensitivity analysis.

               	   	Internet of Vehicles (IoV, shortly) is a typical system of Internet of Things. Spatio-Temporal event stream is one of basic features of IoV. These event streams often are uncertain due to the limit of the monitoring device and the high speed of vehicles. Developing an event processing language to process these spatio-temporal event streams with uncertainty is a challenge issue. The goal of this paper is to develop a Probabilistic Event Processing Language, called as Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Event Processing language (PSTEP, shortly), dealing with this challenge issue. In PSTEP, we use the Possible World Model to express uncertain spatio-temporal events of IoV and assign a spatio-temporal event with a probability which is the threshold value for processing the existence of an event. We establish its syntax and operational semantics. Finally, a case study is given to show the effectiveness of the PSTEP language.

               	   	This paper systematically deals with robust consensus of uncertain linear multi-agent systems via dynamic output-feedback protocols. Agents are assumed to have identical nominal linear time-invariant dynamics but are subject to heterogeneous additive stable perturbations. Dynamic output-feedback protocols with or without controller state information exchange between neighboring controllers are studied in a unified framework. Two methods are proposed for protocol design, which need to solve an algebraic Riccati equation and some scalar/matrix inequalities. The first method characterizes some key parameters by scalar inequalities related to the nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian, which requires the diagonalizability of the Laplacian, while the second method characterizes the parameters by linear matrix inequalities, which circumvents the requirement of the diagonalizability of the Laplacian. Compared with existing results, the proposed approach can simultaneously cope with heterogeneous uncertainties and directed communication graphs. Numerical results verify the advantages of the proposed design methods.

Probabilistic optimal power flow (OPF) analysis is required to accomplish the electrical and economic operational goals. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to accelerate the computation of probabilistic OPF for large-scale smart grids through network reduction (NR). Cumulant-based method and Gram-Charlier expansion theory are used to efficiently obtain the statistics of system states. We develop a more accurate linear mapping method to compute the unknown cumulants. Our method speeds up the computation by up to 4.57X and can improve around 30% accuracy when Hessian matrix is ill-conditioned compared to the previous approach.

               	   Self-healing cyber-physical systems (SH-CPSs) detect and recover from faults by themselves at runtime. Testing such systems is challenging due to the complex implementation of self-healing behaviors and their interaction with the physical environment, both of which are uncertain. To this end, we propose an executable model-based approach to test self-healing behaviors under environmental uncertainties. The approach consists of a Modeling Framework of SH-CPSs (MoSH) and an accompanying Test Model Executor (TM-Executor). MoSH provides a set of modeling constructs and a methodology to specify executable test models, which capture expected system behaviors and environmental uncertainties. TM-Executor executes the test models together with the systems under test, to dynamically test their self-healing behaviors under uncertainties. We demonstrated the successful application of MoSH to specify 11 self-healing behaviors and 17 uncertainties for three SH-CPSs. The time spent by TM-Executor to perform testing activities was in the order of milliseconds, though the time spent was strongly correlated with the complexity of test models.

Such behaviors make decisions autonomously at runtime and they often operate in an uncertain physical environment making testing even more challenging. To this end, we propose Fragility-Oriented Testing (FOT), which relies on model execution and reinforcement learning to cost-effectively test self-healing behaviors of CPSs in the presence of environmental uncertainty. We evaluated FOT’s performance by comparing it with a Coverage-Oriented Testing (COT) algorithm. Evaluation results show that FOT significantly outperformed COT for testing nine self-healing behaviors implemented in three case studies. On average, FOT managed to find 80% more faults than COT and for cases when both FOT and COT found the same faults, FOT took on average 50% less time than COT.

               	   The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to connect billions of devices, that will interact with their physical environment through sensors or actuators.

                               A critical issue in the Web of Things (WoT) is the need to process and analyze the interactions of Web-interconnected real-world objects. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a powerful technology for analyzing streams of information about real-time distributed events, coming from different sources, and for extracting conclusions from them. However, in many situations these events are not free from uncertainty, due to either unreliable data sources and networks, measurement uncertainty, or to the inability to determine whether an event has actually happened or not. This short research paper discusses how CEP systems can incorporate different kinds of uncertainty, both in the events and in the rules. A case study is used to validate the proposal, and we discuss the benefits and limitations of this CEP extension.

                                Crowded public venues are significantly under risks and uncertainties caused by fire and overcrowding hazards. For this purpose, Situational Awareness (SiA) -that is a mechanism to know what is going on around- can facilitate the automatic (or human involved) critical decision making and executing processes. Considering the dynamic and uncertain essence of crowd and hazard behavior in an emergency, executing the optimum evacuation plan is highly complex and needs strong models. In this paper, taking in input a model of the Cyber-Physical Space under SiA monitoring, we define an architectural-map-based Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to describe and predict crowd and hazard behavior. Then, in order to minimize the total evacuation time, the authors present a quickest flow model for consecutive time intervals. Overall, the paper shows the importance of hazard quiddity, and crowd behavior on the evacuation efficiency in emergency situations. The approach is demonstrated through a small (but concrete) running example.

                                This paper develops a model-based framework for the quantification and propagation of multiple uncertainty sources affecting the performance of a smart system. A smart system, in general, performs sensing, control and actuation for proper functioning of a physical subsystem (also referred to as a plant). With strong feedback coupling between several subsystems, the uncertainty in the quantities of interest (QoI) amplifies over time. The coupling in a generic smart system occurs at two levels: (1) coupling between individual subsystems (plant, cyber, actuation, sensors), and (2) coupling between nodes in a distributed computational subsystem. In this paper, a coupled smart system is decoupled and considered as a feed-forward system over time and modeled using a two-level Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), one at each level of coupling (between subsystems and between nodes). A DBN can aggregate uncertainty from multiple sources within a time step and across time steps. The DBN associated with a smart system can be learned using available system models, physics models and data. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for the design of a smart indoor heating system (identification of sensors and a wireless network) within cost constraints that enables room-by-room temperature control. We observe that sensor uncertainty has a higher impact on the performance of the heating system compared to the uncertainty in the wireless network.

                                Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are expected to continuously monitor the physical components to autonomously calculate appropriate runtime reactions to deal with the uncertain environmental conditions. Self-adaptation, as a promising concept to fulfill a set of provable rules, majorly needs runtime quantitative verification (RQV). Taking a few probabilistic variables into account to represent the uncertainties, the system configuration will be extremely large. Thus, efficient approaches are needed to reduce the model state-space, preferably with certain bounds on the approximation error. In this paper, we propose an approximation framework to efficiently approximate the entire model of a self-adaptive system. We split up the large model into strongly-connected components (SCCs), apply the approximation algorithm separately on each SCC, and integrate the result of each part using a centralized algorithm. Due to a number of changes in probabilistic variables, it is not possible to use static models. Addressing this issue, we have deployed parametric Markov decision process. In order to apply approximation on the model, the notion of ε-approximate probabilistic bisimulation is utilized that introduces the approximation level ε. We show that our approximation framework offers a certain error bound on each level of approximation. Then, we denote that the approximation framework is appropriate to be applied in decision-making process of self-adaptive systems where the models are relatively large. The results reveal that we can achieve up to 50% size reduction in the approximate model while maintaining the accuracy about 95%. In addition, we discuss about the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy of our approximation framework.

                                A challenging issue in the architectural design of a System-of-Systems (SoS) is how to cope with the uncertainty raised by the limited knowledge of the operational environment where the SoS will actually be deployed as well as the constituent systems which will concretely participate in the SoS at run-time. It is especially the case of SoSs being architected on the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Indeed, due to the open and dynamic nature of the IoT, on the one hand, at design-time, most often the SoS architects do not know which will be the concrete IoT systems that will become constituents of an SoS, these being predominantly identified at run-time; on the other hand, the correct architecture depends not only on the constituent IoT systems but also, largely, on the operational environment where the SoS will be positioned on the IoT. The consequent research question is thereby how to design and describe the SoS architecture in a way that is flexible enough to cope with these different uncertainties. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the notion of uncertainty in SoS and presents how SosADL, a formal SoS Architecture Description Language (ADL), enables to cope with uncertainty in the architecture modeling of SoSs. It presents the concepts and constructs that makes possible to describe SoS architectures which will operate in unpredictable environments on the IoT based on the SosADL support for dealing with partial knowledge, grounded on concurrent constraints.

                                Detecting the anomalies timely in the condition monitoring data, which are highly relevant to the potential system faults, has become a research focus in many domains. Among the various detection methods available, the prediction-based algorithms are popular without using prior knowledge and expert labels. Additionally, these methods can take the time-ordered specialty into account which is highly significant for time-series-based anomaly detection. However, the detected feedback is binary, especially, due to the influence of inaccurate confidence interval (CI), the false alarm phenomena occur frequently based on predicted models. Thus this paper proposes an Uncertainty Fusion method to realize anomaly detection. Firstly, in order to estimate the data uncertainty, the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is applied to perform the prediction with uncertainty presentation. Then, based on the GPR model, the improved k-fold cross-validation is combined to represent the model uncertainty. Moreover, the quantitative error index is designed to provide more detecting information for decision-making. Eventually, the effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by different simulated and open-source data sets, as well as the real application in mobile traffic data detecting. The quantitative results on simulated data experiments show the proposed method can largely eliminate the false alarms without sacrificing much detection rate compared with the basic GPR model. Especially, the experiments on periodic data sets with high Signal Noise Ratio have the better performance. And the mobile traffic data detecting proves the Uncertainty Fusion method can expand the basic GPR model to meet the real industrial requirements.

                                The enhancement in the number of sensors deployed to collect every single bit of information to develop intelligent applications is potentially growing in today's Internet of Things paradigm. The acquired data from sensors is to be inferred into meaningful information for decision making to address real world situations. Context information modeling and reasoning is one of the investigative research concern in the design and development of smart health care applications. As the accessed information is inherently imperfect, we propose a computational intelligence technique to analyze uncertainty associated with sensor data. In this paper, we propose Context Information, Observation and Belief (C-IOB) model from the perspective of in-hospital environment and the analysis is based on Bayesian network to deal with imprecise information. The proposed model provides a relevant service based on our research findings.

                                The popular use of wearable devices and mobile phones makes the effective capture of life-logging physical activity (PA) data in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment possible. The effective collection of measures of PA in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers and patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, life-logging PA information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this study, the authors project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as daily activity in physical space and present an ellipse-fitting model-based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging PA measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method remarkably improves the validity of PA measures in a healthcare platform.

                                The sharing of data and resources in Future Internet applications (Machine-to-Machine (M2M), Internet of Things (IoT), Web of People (Web2.0), Web of Data (Web3.0)) and the massive distribution of data sources introduces heterogeneity in the Quality of Information (QoI) produced. It is thus necessary to be able to evaluate the QoI at any time and to take it into account for further processing and analysis. In this paper, we present an extension of a semantic context broker which enables to handle the dual problems of trust amongst the data sources and uncertainty in the context data. This extension is based on incorporating one ontology for modeling uncertainty and one ontology for modeling trust, to an IoT ontology that the initial semantic context broker was already based upon. The resulting system has been implemented and tested successfully on real data.

                                The Internet of Things (IoT) connects millions of devices of different cyber-physical systems (CPSs) providing the CPSs additional (implicit) redundancy during runtime. However, the increasing level of dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity adds to the system's vulnerability, and challenges its ability to react to faults. Self-healing is an increasingly popular approach for ensuring resilience, that is, a proper monitoring and recovery, in CPSs. This work encodes and searches an adaptive knowledge base in Prolog/ProbLog that models relations among system variables given that certain implicit redundancy exists in the system. We exploit the redundancy represented in our knowledge base to generate adaptive runtime monitors which compare related signals by considering uncertainties in space and time. This enables the comparison of uncertain, asynchronous, multi-rate and delayed measurements. The monitor is used to trigger the recovery process of a self-healing mechanism. We demonstrate our approach by deploying it in a real-world CPS prototype of a rover whose sensors are susceptible to failure.

               	   			Trust and uncertainty are important aspects of many distributed systems. Managing them together forms a complex problem, even more in the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), where having multiple sources of information is very common. The devices of the IoT face two-fold problems of managing trust on sources and the presence of uncertainty in the information. We propose a solution to these problems. Our solution approach involves modeling applications of the IoT as intelligent agents that comprise a trust management module, an inference engine and an enhanced Assumption-based Truth Maintenance System (ATMS) to manage trust of the information sources and uncertainty of the inferred information. We validate our approach using empirical data obtained from simulations.

               	   			Distributed fault diagnosis has been proposed as an effective technique for monitoring large scale, nonlinear and uncertain systems. It is based on the decomposition of the large scale system into a number of interconnected subsystems, each one monitored by a dedicated Local Fault Detector (LFD). Neighboring LFDs, in order to successfully account for subsystems interconnection, are thus required to communicate with each other some of the measurements from their subsystems. Anyway, such communication may expose private information of a given subsystem, such as its local input. To avoid this problem, we propose here to use differential privacy to pre-process data before transmission.

               	   			Designing secure cyber-physical systems (CPS) is a particularly difficult task since security vulnerabilities stem not only from traditional cybersecurity concerns, but also physical ones. Many of the standard methods for CPS design make strong and unverified assumptions about the trustworthiness of physical devices, such as sensors. When these assumptions are violated, subtle inter-domain vulnerabilities are introduced into the system model. In this paper we use formal specification of analysis contracts to expose security assumptions and guarantees of analyses from reliability, control, and sensor security domains. We show that this specification allows us to determine where these assumptions are violated, opening the door to malicious attacks. We demonstrate how this approach can help discover and prevent vulnerabilities using a self-driving car example.

               	   			The utility of wearables is currently limited to lab experiments and controlled environments mainly because computational algorithms embedded in wearables fail to produce accurate measurements in uncontrolled, dynamically changing, and potentially harsh environments. With the exponentially growing adoption of these systems in human-centered Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, development of resource-efficient solutions to enhance the accuracy of this systems remains a considerable research challenge. In this paper, we introduce an energy-efficient framework for uncertainty management of networked wearables. The core components of our framework are anomaly screening units for detecting anomalies that require handling, thus resulting in one order of magnitude less energy consumption compared to the conventional frameworks. Furthermore, our screening approach achieves 98.3% accuracy in detecting anomalies based on real data collected with wearable motion sensors.

               	   			A cyber-physical system (CPS) comprises several connected, embedded systems and is additionally equipped with sensors and actuators. Thus, CPSs can communicate with their cyber environment and measure and interact with their physical environment. Due to the complexity of their operational environment, assumptions the manufacturer have made may not hold in operation. During an unforeseen environmental situation, a CPS may expose behavior that negatively impactsits reliability. This may arise due to insufficiently considered environmental conditions during the design of a CPS, or – even worse – it is impossible to anticipate such conditions. In the U-Test project, we are developing a configurable search-based testing framework that exploits information from functional testing and from declarative descriptions of uncertainties. Itaims at revealing unintended behavior in the presence of uncertainties. This framework enables testing for different scenarios of uncertainty and thus, allows to achieve a certain coverage of those, and to find unknown uncertainty scenarios.

               	   			Industry 4.0 is the fourth and current working paradigm leaning on data exchange, data analysis and Internet of things for complete automation and optimization of manufacturing technologies. This 4.0 paradigm enables the possibility for optimal autonomous decision making and full autonomous operation of the facility. Since all manufacturing processes are inherently in-deterministic, optimal decision making will only work when provided with realistic uncertainty models. The authors have observed that the typical used prediction models are not accurate as they do not represent the in-deterministic nature of the processes in a realistic manner. The objective of this paper is to use the IoT- based logged data to design more relevant uncertainty models to optimize the industry 4.0 framework. For this purpose, p-box models are used to represent production variation as function of unknown in-deterministic parameters. Furthermore, by using regression learning on the database, we show that the uncertainty can be decreased. It is shown that classic stochastic models are not able to capture the full in-deterministic nature of the uncertainties. It makes therefore sense that autonomous decision making based on such stochastic models are unreliable and sub-optimal. Future research possibilities are discussed, based on the proposed uncertainty models, together with possible notions that will help in the development of reliable optimal decision making and more accurate adaptable Industry 4.0 framework.

               	   			Due to the uncertainty of what actual adaptations will be performed at run time, verifying adaptive systems at design time may lead to limited results or may even be infeasible. Run-time verification techniques have been proposed to cope with this uncertainty. Recently, there has been an increasing interest to use model checking (an important verification technique) at run time in order to verify the expected properties of adaptive systems. Given a system specification and expected system properties, a model checker determines whether or not the specification satisfies its properties in the presence of self-adaptation. One key concern is the generally high resource needs of model checking, which may prohibit its use on resource- and power-constrained devices, such as smart-phones or Internet-of-Things devices. To address this challenge, we introduce a cloud-based framework that delivers model checking as a service (MCaaS). MCaaS offloads computationally intensive model checking tasks to the cloud, thereby offering verification capabilities on demand. Adaptive systems running on any kind of connected device may take the advantages of model checking at run time by invoking the MCaaS service. To dynamically allocate the required cloud resources (CPU and memory), we employ machine learning to estimate the resource usage of an actual model checking task at run time. As proof of concept, we implement and validate the approach for the case of probabilistic model checking, which facilitates verifying typical properties such as reliability.

               	   			Self-adaptation provides a principled way to deal with software systems’ uncertainty during operation. Examples of such uncertainties are disturbances in the environment, variations in sensor readings, and changes in user requirements. As more systems with strict goals require self-adaptation, the need for formal guarantees in self-adaptive systems is becoming a high-priority concern. Designing self-adaptive software using principles from control theory has been identified as one of the approaches to provide guarantees. In general, self-adaptation covers a wide range of approaches to maintain system requirements under uncertainty, ranging from dynamic adaptation of system parameters to runtime architectural reconfiguration. Existing control-theoretic approaches have mainly focused on handling requirements in the form of setpoint values or as quantities to be optimized. Furthermore, existing research primarily focuses on handling uncertainty in the execution environment. This article presents SimCA*, which provides two contributions to the state-of-the-art in control-theoretic adaptation: (i) it supports requirements that keep a value above and below a required threshold, in addition to setpoint and optimization requirements; and (ii) it deals with uncertainty in system parameters, component interactions, system requirements, in addition to uncertainty in the environment. SimCA* provides guarantees for the three types of requirements of the system that is subject to different types of uncertainties. We evaluate SimCA* for two systems with strict requirements from different domains: an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle system used for oceanic surveillance and an Internet of Things application for monitoring a geographical area. The test results confirm that SimCA* can satisfy the three types of requirements in the presence of different types of uncertainty.

                                Acceptance testing validates that a system meets its requirements and determines whether it can be sufficiently trusted and put into operation. For cyber physical systems (CPS), acceptance testing is a hardware-in-the-loop process conducted in a (near-)operational environment. Acceptance testing of a CPS often necessitates that the test cases be prioritized, as there are usually too many scenarios to consider given time constraints. CPS acceptance testing is further complicated by the uncertainty in the environment and the impact of testing on hardware. We propose an automated test case prioritization approach for CPS acceptance testing, accounting for time budget constraints, uncertainty, and hardware damage risks. Our approach is based on multi-objective search, combined with a test case minimization algorithm that eliminates redundant operations from an ordered sequence of test cases. We evaluate our approach on a representative case study from the satellite domain. The results indicate that, compared to test cases that are prioritized manually by satellite engineers, our automated approach more than doubles the number of test cases that fit into a given time frame, while reducing to less than one third the number of operations that entail the risk of damage to key hardware components.

                                Process algebra is one of the best suitable formal methods to model smart systems based on IoT, especially Smart Factory. However, because of some uncertainty, it is necessary to model predictability of the systems, based on the uncertainty. There have been several process algebras with probability, such as, PAROMA, PACSR, etc. However they are not well suitable for the smart systems, since they are based only on discrete model or exponential model. Consequently, only simple or targeted probability can be specified and analyzed. In order to handle such limitations, the paper presents a new formal method, called dTP-Calculus, extended from the existing dT-Calculus with discrete, normal, exponential, and uniform probability models. It provides all the possible probability features for Smart Factory with complex uncertainty. The specification of the modeling will be simulated statistically for Smart Factory, and further the simulation results will be analyzed for probabilistic properties of the systems. For implementation, a tool set for the calculus has been developed in the SAVE tool suite on the ADOxx Meta-Modeling Platform, including Specifier, Analyzer and Verifier. A Smart Factory example from Audi Cell Production System has been selected as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

                                Timeliness, accuracy and effectiveness of manufacturing information in manufacturing and business process management have become important factors of constraint to business growth. Single RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology with uncertainty will cause great difficulties for application systems. This paper mainly focuses on the process of manufacturing information, real-time information perception and processing problems. It achieves real-time manufacturing information acquisition and processing by combining RFID and sensor technology, which uses Complex Event Processing (CEP) mechanism to realize sensor and RFID data fusion. First of all, the event processing framework which is from the perspective of the integration of sensors and RFID is given. Then, real-time acquisition and intelligent information processing models were introduced, including primitive event handling and complex event processing method. Finally, the practicality of our method was verified through applying it to a mold manufacturing enterprise management field.

                                Structured and unstructured uncertainties together with external disturbances may pose considerable challenges in realizing desired path-tacking and lane keeping of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a novel robust adaptive indirect control method based on an exponential-like-sliding-mode fuzzy type-2 neural network approach for enhanced path-tracking performance of road autonomous vehicles subject to parametric uncertainties related to vehicle nominal cornering stiffness, road-tire adhesion coefficient, inertial parameters, and forward speed. A hierarchical controller is designed and the stability of the closed-loop system is ensured along with deriving the adaptation laws by employing the Lyapunov stability theorem. The conventional reaching law related to the sliding mode degrades from the system stability and introduces an inherent chattering of the controller input. The convergence law for the sliding surface is adjusted based on a variable exponential sliding manifold to eliminate possible chattering in the buffeting switch zone near the origin. The proposed exponential-like sliding surface guarantees the swift and smooth global asymptotic convergence of the tracking error toward zero. Furthermore, an adaptive look-ahead path-tracking error term is introduced as an auxiliary error criterion to improve the vehicle path-tracking performance. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified through Matlab/Simulink–CarSim co-simulations and comparisons with selected reported control methods for two different road maneuvers. The results suggested substantially improved tracking performance by the proposed controller with robustness to withstand against the perturbed parameters and external disturbances.

                                Many Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are composed of low-cost devices that are deeply integrated with physical environments. As a result, the performance of a CPS system is inevitably undermined by various physical uncertainties, which include stochastic noises, hardware biases, unpredictable environment changes, and dynamics of the physical process of interest. Traditional solutions to these issues (e.g., device calibration and collaborative signal processing) work in an open-loop fashion and hence often fail to adapt to the uncertainties after system deployment. In this article, we propose an adaptive system-level calibration approach for a class of CPS systems whose primary objective is to detect events or targets of interest. Through collaborative data fusion, our calibration approach features a feedback control loop that exploits system heterogeneity to mitigate the impact of aforementioned uncertainties on the system performance. In contrast to existing heuristic-based solutions, our control-theoretical calibration algorithm can ensure provable system stability and convergence. We also develop a routing algorithm for fusion-based multihop CPS systems that is robust to communication unreliability and delay. Our approach is evaluated by both experiments on a testbed of Tmotes as well as extensive simulations based on data traces gathered from a real vehicle detection experiment. The results demonstrate that our calibration algorithm enables a CPS system to maintain the optimal sensing performance in the presence of various system and environmental dynamics.

                                Today's cyber-physical systems (CPS) span IoT and cloud-based datacenter infrastructures, which are highly heterogeneous with various types of uncertainty. Thus, testing uncertainties in these CPS is a challenging and multidisciplinary activity. We need several tools for modeling, deployment, control, and analytics to test and evaluate uncertainties for different configurations of the same CPS. In this paper, we explain why using state-of-the art model-driven engineering (MDE) and model-based testing (MBT) tools is not adequate for testing uncertainties of CPS in IoT Cloud infrastructures. We discus how to combine them with techniques for elastic execution to dynamically provision both CPS under test and testing utilities to perform tests in various IoT Cloud infrastructures.

                                We increasingly live in cyber-physical spaces: spaces that are both physical and digital, and where the two aspects are intertwined. Cyber-physical spaces may exhibit a range of behaviors, from smart control of heating, ventilation, and light to visionary multi-functional living spaces that can be spatially re-organized in a dynamic way. In contrast to traditional physical environments, cyber-physical spaces often exhibit dynamic behaviors: they can change over time and react to changes occurring in space. Current design of spaces, however, does not normally accommodate the cyber aspects of modern spatial environments and does not capture their dynamic behavior. Spatial design, although done with CAD tools and following certain international processes and standards, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), largely produces syntactic descriptions of spaces which lack dynamic semantics. As a consequence, designs cannot be automatically (and formally) analyzed with respect to various requirements emerging from dynamic cyber-physical spaces; safety, security or reliability requirements being typical examples of this. This paper will show an avenue for research which can be characterized as rethinking the design of spatial environments, i.e., dynamic cyber-physical spaces, from a software engineering perspective. We outline our approach where formally analyzable models may be automatically extracted from BIM depending on the analysis required, and then checked against formally specified requirements, both regarding static and dynamic properties of the design, prior to the construction phase (at design time). To realize automated operational management, these models can also be used during operation to continuously check satisfaction of the requirements when changes occur, and possibly enforce their satisfaction through self-adaptive strategies (at run-time).

                                A new context-aware data- and patient-centric paradigm for ubiquitous healthcare is central to deliver personalized healthcare solutions to the elderly and the physically challenged. However, this new paradigm requires real-time in-the-field processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models and analysis of the processed information (derived physiological parameters) under context (e.g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, an innovative resource provisioning framework that harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., smart phones, laptops, tablets, DVRs, medical terminals) to form a mobile computing grid is presented. The framework is imparted with self-optimization and self-healing capabilities for efficiency and robustness under uncertainty, respectively. The proposed mobile grid management framework serves as a key enabling technology for Internet-of-Things- (IoT-) based next-generation ubiquitous healthcare solutions.

                                One of the main purposes of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems is to provide information on the observed physical system and to notify when a certain observed complex event occurs in the system. The biggest challenge of the IoT systems is that the systems collect a massive amount of uncertain data from diverse IoT devices, where the devices are connected through the internet. In addition to that, some events are inferred from other events and uncertainty is propagated from parent events to the inferred events, which additionally contributes to overall system uncertainty. The observed complex events are a complex relationship of primitive events that are produced by IoT devices and collected in IoT system. There were a couple of attempts to quantify the system uncertainty by estimating the likelihood of the occurrence of events of interest while taking into account the uncertain data and uncertain parameters of the model of the physical system with rule-based complex event processing and/or Bayesian network. These methods were implemented as stand-alone software solutions that are unable to scale under heavy loads of incoming events. This paper proposes a micro-service based notification methodology that uses complex event recognition to handle the IoT system uncertainty.

                                In this paper, we present a new tool SReach, which solves probabilistic bounded reachability problems for two classes of models of stochastic hybrid systems. The first one is (nonlinear) hybrid automata with parametric uncertainty. The second one is probabilistic hybrid automata with additional randomness for both transition probabilities and variable resets. Standard approaches to reachability problems for linear hybrid systems require numerical solutions for large optimization problems, and become infeasible for systems involving both nonlinear dynamics over the reals and stochasticity. SReach encodes stochastic information by using a set of introduced random variables, and combines  \(\delta \) -complete decision procedures and statistical tests to solve  \(\delta \) -reachability problems in a sound manner. Compared to standard simulation-based methods, it supports non-deterministic branching, increases the coverage of simulation, and avoids the zero-crossing problem. We demonstrate SReach’s applicability by discussing three representative biological models and additional benchmarks for nonlinear hybrid systems with multiple probabilistic system parameters.

                               Internet of Things devices, such as video-based detectors or road side units are being deployed in emerging applications like sustainable and intelligent transportation systems. Oftentimes, stringent operation and energy cost constraints are exerted on this type of applications, necessitating a hybrid supply of renewable and grid energy. The key issue of a cost-constrained hybrid of renewable and grid power is its uncertainty in energy availability. The characteristic of approximate computation that accepts an approximate result when energy is limited and executes more computations yielding better results if more energy is available, can be exploited to intelligently handle the uncertainty. In this paper, we first propose an energy-adaptive task allocation scheme that optimally assigns real-time approximate-computation tasks to individual processors and subsequently enables a matching of the cost-constrained hybrid supply of energy with the energy demand of the resultant task schedule. We then present a quality of service (QoS)-driven task scheduling scheme that determines the optional execution cycles of tasks on individual processors for optimization of system QoS. A dynamic task scheduling scheme is also designed to adapt at runtime the task execution to the varying amount of the available energy. Simulation results show that our schemes can reduce system energy consumption by up to 29% and improve system QoS by up to 108% as compared to benchmarking algorithms.

                               Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is widely used to track and trace objects in supply chain management. However, massive uncertain data produced by RFID readers are not suitable for directly use in RFID applications. Following our thorough analysis of key features of RFID objects, this paper proposes a new framework for effectively and efficiently processing uncertain RFID data, and supporting a variety of queries for tracking and tracing RFID objects. In particular, we propose an adaptive cleaning method by adjusting size of smoothing window according to various rates of uncertain data, employing different strategies to process uncertain readings, and distinguishing different types of uncertain data according to their appearing positions. We propose a comprehensive data model, which is suitable for a wide range of application scenarios. In addition, a path coding scheme is proposed to significantly compress massive data by aggregating the path sequences, the positions and the time intervals. Experimental evaluations show that our approach is effective and efficient in terms of the compression and traceability queries.

                               Device-to-device communication is widely used for mobile devices and Internet of Things. Authentication and key agreement are critical to build a secure channel between two devices. However, existing approaches often rely on a pre-built fingerprint database and suffer from low key generation rate. We present GeneWave, a fast device authentication and key agreement protocol for commodity mobile devices. GeneWave first achieves bidirectional initial authentication based on the physical response interval between two devices. To keep the accuracy of interval estimation, we eliminate time uncertainty on commodity devices through fast signal detection and redundancy time cancellation. Then, we derive the initial acoustic channel response for device authentication. We design a novel coding scheme for efficient key agreement while ensuring security. Therefore, two devices can authenticate each other and securely agree on a symmetric key. GeneWave requires neither special hardware nor pre-built fingerprint database, and thus it is easyto-use on commercial mobile devices. We implement GeneWave on mobile devices (i.e., Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P) and evaluate its performance through extensive experiments. Experimental results show that GeneWave efficiently accomplish secure key agreement on commodity smartphones with a key generation rate 10× faster than the state-of-the-art approach.

                              Since Internet of Things (IoT) applications are deployed within open physical environments, their executions suffer from a wide spectrum of uncertain factors (e.g., network delay, sensor inputs). Although ThingML is a promising IoT modeling and specification language which enables the fast development of resource-constrained IoT applications, it lacks the capability to model such uncertainties and quantify their effects. Consequently, within uncertain environments the quality and performance of IoT applications generated from ThingML designs cannot be guaranteed. To explore the overall runtime performance variations caused by environmental uncertainties, this paper proposes a quantitative uncertainty evaluation framework for ThingML-based IoT designs. By adopting network of priced timed automata as the model of computation and statistical model checking as the evaluation engine, our approach can model uncertainties caused by external environments as well as support various kinds of performance queries on the extended ThingML designs. Experimental results of two comprehensive case studies demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

                              In complex cyber-physical system operations, fault detection needs to be performed using limited state information for practicality and privacy concerns. While a well-designed observation can distinguish a faulty behavior from the normal behavior, it can also represent the action of hiding some of the state information or discrete mode switchings. In this paper, we present a method for constructing the observation maps in the form of metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas that can be formally proven to detect fault in a switched system, while preserving certain privacy conditions. We provide a theoretical framework of robust temporal logic inference for classification of switched system trajectories with spatial and temporal uncertainties. We simulate finitely many nominal trajectories and use the robust neighborhoods around the simulated trajectories to cover the infinite trajectories that constitute the system behavior. Thus, the designed observation maps with the inferred MTL formulas can detect fault and preserve privacy in a provably correct fashion. Our approach is implemented on the simulation model of a smart building testbed to detect thermal leakage in the room, while preserving multiple privacy conditions of the room occupancy.

                              The Internet of Things is the natural continuity of the Ambient Intelligence where smart and ambient environments are built mainly by integrating a large number of interconnected smart objects (sensors, actuators, Smartphone, appliances, etc.) with heterogeneous capabilities abstracted as software services. These services can be composed on the fly and provided, all the time and everywhere, to assist users in their daily activities. A key issue in user-centered services composition is to intelligently and effectively discover and select the most relevant services that best match the users' requirements and closely meet the specified quality-of-service level. Monitoring seamlessly the provided services and enhancing their quality, is still a challenging issue due mainly to the dynamicity and uncertainty characterizing ambient environments. In this paper, we propose a new service-oriented, user-centered and event-aware Framework capable of performing services monitoring to handle automatically events that may occur in ambient environments. This monitoring is based on a dynamic services discovery and selection process to enhance self-adaptation to unpredicted changes, and ensure services continuity with best quality. The overall proposed Framework has been implemented and validated through a scenario dedicated to daily activity recognition in an Ambient-Assisted Living environment. In addition, the obtained performances from extensive tests show clearly the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed approach in the case of a large-scale environment.

                             Recently, the popular use of wearable devices and mobile apps makes the effectively capture of lifelogging physical activity data in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment possible. The effective collection of measures of physical activity in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers to patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging physical activity information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing life-logging physical activity measurement devices, and identify regular and irregular uncertainties of these activity measures in an IoT environment. We then project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as Daily Activity in Physical Space (DAPS). Finally, we present an ellipse fitting model based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging physical activity measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method effectively improves the validity of physical activity measures in a healthcare platform.

                             Internet of Things (IoT) technology offers opportunities to monitor lifelogging data by a variety of assets, like wearable sensors, mobile apps, etc. But due to heterogeneity of connected devices and diverse human life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging personal data contains huge uncertainty and are hardly used for healthcare studies. Effective validation of lifelogging personal data for longitudinal health assessment is demanded. In this paper, lifelogging physical activity (LPA) is taken as a target to explore how to improve the validity of lifelogging data in an IoT enabled healthcare system. A rule-based adaptive LPA validation (LPAV) model, LPAV-IoT, is proposed for eliminating irregular uncertainties (IUs) and estimating data reliability in IoT healthcare environments. A methodology specifying four layers and three modules in LPAV-IoT is presented for analyzing key factors impacting validity of LPA. A series of validation rules are designed with uncertainty threshold parameters and reliability indicators and evaluated through experimental investigations. Following LPAV-IoT, a case study on a personalized healthcare platform myhealthavatar connecting three state-of-the-art wearable devices and mobile apps are carried out. The results reflect that the rules provided by LPAV-IoT enable efficiently filtering at least 75% of IU and adaptively indicating the reliability of LPA data on certain condition of IoT environments.

                             Due to the ability to handle uncertain nonlinear hybrid systems, barrier certificate based method has been widely used in safety verification problem. In this paper, an efficient framework, combining sum of squares programming with interval analysis, is proposed to generate barrier certificates for uncertain nonlinear hybrid systems. It utilizes the feature of bounded uncertainties to get a deterministic hybrid system, whose barrier certificates can be efficiently computed using sum of squares programming. The computed barrier certificates are then chosen as candidate barrier certificates for the original uncertain hybrid system, and need to be checked the satisfaction of the associated barrier certificate conditions, via an interval analysis based method. As an application, our approach is used to verify safety properties of non-polynomial hybrid systems. Some experimental results are given to show the efficiency of our approach.

                             With the economic globalization and the intensification of market competition, competition between enterprises has developed into competition between supply chains. The influence and change of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology on the spatial structure and economic relationship of supply chain are all-round and profound, and then affect the allocation of resources and supply chain operation, which will lead to many new management problems. These problems will become a new field of enterprise supply chain management innovation. Based on the fuzzy theory, this paper uses six-point fuzzy numbers to represent the uncertainty in the supply chain and uses the possibility theory to establish the evaluation criteria for the overall performance of the supply chain. In order to satisfy the constraints of the final product order fulfillment rate and minimize the overall inventory cost of the supply chain, the model integrates and optimizes the manufacturing resource allocation strategy of the supply chain in the IoT. Finally, the effectiveness of the model is verified by simulation, which provides theoretical support for the decision-making of the supply chain enterprises in the IoT environment

                             Runtime uncertainty such as unpredictable resource unavailability, changing environmental conditions and user needs, as well as system intrusions or faults represents one of the main current challenges of self-adaptive systems. Moreover, today's systems are increasingly more complex, distributed, decentralized, etc. and therefore have to reason about and cope with more and more unpredictable events. Approaches to deal with such changing requirements in complex today's systems are still missing. This work presents SACRE (Smart Adaptation through Contextual REquirements), our approach leveraging an adaptation feedback loop to detect self-adaptive systems’ contextual requirements affected by uncertainty and to integrate machine learning techniques to determine the best operationalization of context based on sensed data at runtime. SACRE is a step forward of our former approach ACon which focus had been on adapting the context in contextual requirements, as well as their basic implementation. SACRE primarily focuses on architectural decisions, addressing self-adaptive systems’ engineering challenges. Furthering the work on ACon, in this paper, we perform an evaluation of the entire approach in different uncertainty scenarios in real-time in the extremely demanding domain of smart vehicles. The real-time evaluation is conducted in a simulated environment in which the smart vehicle is implemented through software components. The evaluation results provide empirical evidence about the applicability of SACRE in real and complex software system domains.

                            The intelligent manufacturing strategy and customer demand have mutually promoted each other. Also, the production mode is shifting towards customized production, and more rental resources or services are introduced to the production system, therefore, the systems are becoming more complex. Compared with traditional production systems, such systems have some new features, this work calls this type of system as a synchronized production operation system (SPOS). Under such circumstances, production systems are influenced by more frequent uncertainties, and the planning-based production decision and control approach is no longer applicable. The opti-state control (OsC) method is proposed to help SPOS keep in an optimal state when uncertainties affect the system. Besides, a digital twin-based control framework (DTCF) is designed for getting the full element information needed for decision making. Based on the comprehensive information of the production system obtained by the DTCF, the OsC method is introduced to the virtual control layer to formulate the optimal target guiding the path of the system in real time through the dynamic matching mechanism (qualitative perspective). Then multi-stage synchronized control with analysis target cascading (ATC) method is used to get the local optimal state decisions (quantitative perspective). From both qualitative and quantitative aspects to ensure the system is under an optimal target path for optimal operation procedure. At last, a case study in a large-size paint making company in China is used to validate the effectiveness of the approach.

                            Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) typically operate in highly indeterminate environmental conditions, which require the development of testing methods that must explicitly consider uncertainty in test design, test generation, and test optimization. Towards this direction, we propose a set of uncertainty-wise test case generation and test case minimization strategies that rely on test ready models explicitly specifying subjective uncertainty. We propose two test case generation strategies and four test case minimization strategies based on the Uncertainty Theory and multi-objective search. These strategies include a novel methodology for designing and introducing indeterminacy sources in the environment during test execution and a novel set of uncertainty-wise test verdicts. We performed an extensive empirical study to select the best algorithm out of eight commonly used multi-objective search algorithms, for each of the four minimization strategies, with five use cases of two industrial CPS case studies. The minimized set of test cases obtained with the best algorithm for each minimization strategy were executed on the two real CPSs. The results showed that our best test strategy managed to observe 51% more uncertainties due to unknown indeterminate behaviors of the physical environments of the CPSs as compared to the other test strategies. Also, the same test strategy managed to observe 118% more unknown uncertainties as compared to the unique number of known uncertainties.

                            Context
														Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), when deployed for operation, are inherently prone to uncertainty. Considering their applications in critical domains (e.g., healthcare), it is important that such CPSs are tested sufficiently, with the explicit consideration of uncertainty. Model-based testing (MBT) involves creating test ready models capturing the expected behavior of a CPS and its operating environment. These test ready models are then used for generating executable test cases. It is, therefore, necessary to develop methods that can continuously evolve, based on real operational data collected during the operation of CPSs, test ready models and uncertainty captured in them, all together termed as Belief Test Ready Models (BMs)
														Objective
														Our objective is to propose a model evolution framework that can interactively improve the quality of BMs, based on operational data. Such BMs are developed by one or more test modelers (belief agents) with their assumptions about the expected behavior of a CPS, its expected physical environment, and potential future deployments. Thus, these models explicitly contain subjective uncertainty of the test modelers.
														Method
														We propose a framework (named as UncerTolve) for interactively evolving BMs (specified with extended UML notations) of CPSs with subjective uncertainty developed by test modelers. The key inputs of UncerTolve include initial BMs of CPSs with known subjective uncertainty and real data collected from the operation of CPSs. UncerTolve has three key features: 1) Validating the syntactic correctness and conformance of BMs against real operational data via model execution, 2) Evolving objective uncertainty measurements of BMs via model execution, and 3) Evolving state invariants (modeling test oracles) and guards of transitions (modeling constraints for test data generation) of BMs with a machine learning technique.
														Results
														As a proof-of-concept, we evaluated UncerTolve with one industrial CPS case study, i.e., GeoSports from the healthcare domain. Using UncerTolve, we managed to evolve 51% of belief elements, 18% of states, and 21% of transitions as compared to the initial BM developed in an industrial setting.
														Conclusion
														UncerTolve can successfully evolve model elements of the initial BM, in addition to objective uncertainty measurements using real operational data. The evolved model can be used to generate additional test cases covering evolved model elements and objective uncertainty. These additional test cases can be used to test the current and future deployments of a CPS to ensure that it will handle uncertainty gracefully during its operations.

                            It is important that a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with uncertainty in its behavior caused by its unpredictable operating environment, to ensure its reliable operation. One method to ensure that the CPS will handle such uncertainty during its operation is by testing the CPS with model-based testing (MBT) techniques. However, existing MBT techniques do not explicitly capture uncertainty in test ready models, i.e., capturing the uncertain expected behavior of a CPS in the presence of environment uncertainty. To fill this gap, we present an Uncertainty-Wise test-modeling framework, named as UncerTum, to create test ready models to support MBT of CPSs facing uncertainty. UncerTum relies on the definition of a UML profile [the UML Uncertainty Profile (UUP)] and a set of UML Model Libraries extending the UML profile for Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems (MARTE). UncerTum also benefits from the UML Testing Profile V.2 to support standard-based MBT. UncerTum was evaluated with two industrial CPS case studies, one real-world case study, and one open-source CPS case study from the following four perspectives: (1) Completeness and Coverage of the profiles and Model Libraries in terms of concepts defined in their underlying uncertainty conceptual model for CPSs, i.e., U-Model and MARTE, (2) Effort required to model uncertainty with UncerTum, and (3) Correctness of the developed test ready models, which was assessed via model execution. Based on the evaluation, we can conclude that we were successful in modeling all the uncertainties identified in the four case studies, which gives us an indication that UncerTum is sufficiently complete. In terms of modeling effort, we concluded that on average UncerTum requires 18.5% more time to apply stereotypes from UUP on test ready models.

                            Uncertainty is intrinsic in most technical systems, including Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, handling uncertainty in a graceful manner during the real operation of CPS is critical. Since designing, developing, and testing modern and highly sophisticated CPS is an expanding field, a step towards dealing with uncertainty is to identify, define, and classify uncertainties at various levels of CPS. This will help develop a systematic and comprehensive understanding of uncertainty. To that end, we propose a conceptual model for uncertainty specifically designed for CPS. Since the study of uncertainty in CPS development and testing is still irrelatively unexplored, this conceptual model was derived in a large part by reviewing existing work on uncertainty in other fields, including philosophy, physics, statistics, and healthcare. The conceptual model is mapped to the three logical levels of CPS: Application, Infrastructure, and Integration. It is captured using UML class diagrams, including relevant OCL constraints. To validate the conceptual model, we identified, classified, and specified uncertainties in two distinct industrial case studies.

                            Adaptive systems are expected to adapt to unanticipated run-time events using imperfect information about themselves, their environment, and goals. This entails handling the effects of uncertainties in decision-making, which are not always considered as a first-class concern. This paper contributes a formal analysis technique that explicitly considers uncertainty in sensing when reasoning about the best way to adapt, together with uncertainty reduction mechanisms to improve system utility. We illustrate our approach on a Denial of Service (DoS) attack scenario and present results that demonstrate the benefits of uncertainty-aware decision-making in comparison to using an uncertainty-ignorant approach, both in the presence and absence of uncertainty reduction mechanisms.

                            Self-adaptation is an established approach to deal with uncertainties that are difficult to predict before a system is deployed. A self-adaptative system employs a feedback loop that tracks changes and adapts the system accordingly to ensure its quality goals. However, making effective adaptation decisions at runtime is challenging. In this chapter we tackle two problems of effective decision making in self-adaptive systems. First, current research typically focusses on the benefits adaptaton can bring but ignores the cost of adaptation, which may invalidate the expected benefits. To tackle this problem, we introduce CB@R (Cost-Benefit analysis @ Runtime), a novel model-based approach for runtime decision-making in self-adaptive systems that handles both the benefits and costs of adaptation as first-class citizens in decision making. Second, we look into the adaptation space of self-adaptive systems, i.e. the set of adaption options to select from. For systems with a large number of adaptation options, analyzing the entire adaptation space is often not feasible given the time and resources constraints at hand. To tackle this problem, we present a machine learning approach that integrates learning with the feedback loop to select a subset of the adaption options that are valid in the current situation. We evaluate CB@R and the learning approach for a real world deployed Internet of Things (IoT) application.

               	   	  The electric grid had become a vast complex cyber-physical system, and its digitalization is a reality in the close future that would result in a tremendous amount of information, controls, and uncertainties. Distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed generation (DG), demand response (DR), distributed energy storage systems (DESS), and electric vehicle (EV) are increasing the level of uncertainty but also the capabilities of new controls on the distribution networks. The future electric grid will need more flexibility and coordination between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to be able to operate in a reliable, secure and economical fashion. To overcome uncertainties and reliability issues, DSO is moving toward the so-called active distribution network (ADN) which is the crucial piece of for enabling new flexibility at the TSO level. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the estimation of the ADNs flexibility based on the feasibility region at the TSO-DSO interface. A Monte Carlo sampling method is applied to generate random ADN states. The proposed methodology is analyzed in both the 5-bus ring distribution test system and the 33-bus IEEE radial distribution system.

               	   	  By nature, Cyber-physical systems are very often subjected to uncertainty events that can occur in their environment. This paper presents the first results of our work on how to deal with environment uncertainty in goal-based requirements engineering. This work is motivated by the fact that current goal-based approaches do not natively allow for unanticipated adaptations. To do so, we explore the introduction of RELAX concepts into SysMLKaos. RELAX is a Requirements Engineering language for Dynamically Adaptive Systems that includes explicit constructs to handle the inherent uncertainty in these systems. On the other hand, SysMLKaos is a Goal Based Requirements Engineering approach that takes into account Non-Functional Requirements at the same level of abstraction as Functional Requirements and models the impact of Non-Functional Requirements on Functional Requirements. We use an extract of a Landing Gear System case study to illustrate the proposed approach.

               	   	  Active automata learning algorithms have gained increasing importance in the field of model-based system verification. For some classes of systems - especially deterministic systems, like Mealy machines, a variety of learning algorithm implementations is readily available. In this paper, we apply this technique to a measurement device from the automotive industry in order to systematically test its behaviour. However, our system under learning shows sparse non-deterministic behaviour, preventing the direct application of the available learning tools.
											We propose an implementation of the active automata learning framework which masks this non-determinism. We repeat a previous model-based testing experiment with faulty devices and show that we can detect all injected faults. Most importantly, our technique was also able to find unknown bugs.

               	   	 Multi-objective uncertainty-wise test case minimization focuses on selecting a minimum number of test cases to execute out of all available ones while maximizing effectiveness (e.g., coverage), minimizing cost (e.g., time to execute test cases), and at the same time optimizing uncertainty-related objectives. In our previous unpublished work, we developed four uncertainty-wise test case minimization strategies relying on Uncertainty Theory and multi-objective search (NSGA-II with default settings), which were evaluated with one real Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with inherent uncertainty. However, a fundamental question to answer is whether these default settings of NSGA-II are good enough to provide optimized solutions. In this direction, we report one of the preliminary empirical evaluations, where we performed an experiment with three different mutation operators and three crossover operators, i.e., in total nine combinations with NSGA-II for the four uncertainty-wise test case minimization strategies using a real CPS case study. Results show that the Blend Alpha crossover operator together with the polynomial mutation operator permits NSGA-II achieving the best performance for solving our uncertainty-wise test minimization problems.

               	   	As compared with classical software/system testing, uncertainty-wise testing explicitly addresses known uncertainty about the behavior of a System Under Test (SUT), its operating environment, and interactions between the SUT and its operational environment, across all testing phases, including test design, test generation, test optimization, and test execution, with the aim to mainly achieve the following two goals. First, uncertainty-wise testing aims to ensure that the SUT deals with known uncertainty adequately. Second, uncertainty-wise testing should be also capable of learning new (previously unknown) uncertainties such that the SUT's implementation can be improved to guard against newly learned uncertainties during its operation. The necessity to integrate uncertainty in testing is becoming imperative because of the emergence of new types of intelligent and communicating software-based systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Intrinsically, such systems are exposed to uncertainty because of their interactions with highly indeterminate physical environments. In this chapter, we provide our understanding and experience of uncertainty-wise testing from the aspects of uncertainty-wise model-based testing, uncertainty-wise modeling and evolution of test ready models, and uncertainty-wise multiobjective test optimization, in the context of testing CPSs under uncertainty. Furthermore, we present our vision about this new testing paradigm and its plausible future research directions.

               	   	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are composed of computing devices interacting with physical systems. Model-based design is a powerful methodology in CPS design in the implementation of control systems. For instance, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is typically implemented in CPS applications, e.g., in path tracking of autonomous vehicles. MPC deploys a model to estimate the behavior of the physical system at future time instants for a specific time horizon. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) are the most commonly used models to emulate the behavior of continuous-time (non-)linear dynamical systems. A complex physical model may comprise thousands of ODEs which pose scalability, performance and power consumption challenges. One approach to address these model complexity challenges are frameworks that automate the development of model-to-model transformation. In this paper, we introduce a model generation framework to transform ODE models of a physical system to Hybrid Harmonic Equivalent State (HES) Machine model equivalents. Moreover, tuning parameters are introduced to reconfigure the model and adjust its accuracy from coarse-grained time critical situations to fine-grained scenarios in which safety is paramount. Machine learning techniques are applied to adopt the model to run-time applications. We conduct experiments on a closed-loop MPC for path tracking using the vehicle dynamics model. We analyze the performance of the MPC when applying our Hybrid HES Machine model. The performance of our proposed model is compared with state-of-the-art ODE-based models, in terms of execution time and model accuracy. Our experimental results show a 32% reduction in MPC return time for 0.8% loss in model accuracy.

               	   	For an effective use of a robotic prosthetic, smooth transition between the states of this human-in-the-loop cyber-physical system (or autonomous operation) is crucial. In order to achieve that, taking into account the uncertainties in the robotic system may be as significant as anticipating the human intent. In this study, we present two risk measures associated with a simple grasping task based on the pre-grasp position and orientation of the robotic hand, and analyze them by using a model of a dexterous mechatronic prosthetic arm to simulate a simple grasping task. Moreover, we develop a hybrid position and force grasp controller and use a grasp quality metric to assess the grasps. 34 simulations with different pre-grasp poses were performed to investigate the relationship between the grasp quality and the risk measures as well as the sensitivity of the grasp quality to the pre-grasp position of the hand. Results show that the proposed risk metrics and the pre-grasp position correlate with the grasp quality, yet they are not sufficient to predict the outcome.

We consider two extensions of the notion of weighted Kripke structures, namely (i) parametric weighted Kripke structures, having transitions weights modelled as affine maps over a set of parameters and, (ii) weight-uncertain Kripke structures, having transition labelled by real-valued random variables as opposed to precise real valued weights.
										We address this problem by using extended parametric dependency graphs, a symbolic extension of dependency graphs by Liu and Smolka.

               	   	Development of robust dynamical systems and networks such as autonomous aircraft systems capable of accomplishing complex missions faces challenges due to the dynamically evolving uncertainties coming from model uncertainties, necessity to operate in a hostile cluttered urban environment, and the distributed and dynamic nature of the communication and computation resources. Model-based robust design is difficult because of the complexity of the hybrid dynamic models including continuous vehicle dynamics, the discrete models of computations and communications, and the size of the problem. We will overview recent advances in methodology and tools to model, analyze, and design robust autonomous aerospace systems operating in uncertain environment, with stress on efficient uncertainty quantification and robust design using the case studies of the mission including model-based target tracking and search, and trajectory planning in uncertain urban environment. To show that the methodology is generally applicable to uncertain dynamical systems, we will also show examples of application of the new methods to efficient uncertainty quantification of energy usage in buildings, and stability assessment of interconnected power networks.

               	   	Conventionally, the exposure regarding knowledge of the inter vehicle link duration is a significant parameter in Vehicular Networks to estimate the delay during the failure of a specific link during the transmission. However, the mobility and dynamics of the nodes is considerably higher in a smart city than on highways and thus could emerge a complex random pattern for the investigation of the link duration, referring all sorts of uncertain conditions. There are existing link duration estimation models, which perform linear operations under linear relationships without imprecise conditions. Anticipating, the requirement to tackle the uncertain conditions in Vehicular Networks, this paper presents a hybrid neural network-driven mobility prediction model. The proposed hybrid neural network comprises a Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann machine (FCBM), which allows the random patterns of several vehicles in a single time stamp to be learned. The several dynamic parameters, which may make the contexts of Vehicular Networks uncertain, could be vehicle speed at the moment of prediction, the number of leading vehicles, the average speed of the leading vehicle, the distance to the subsequent intersection of traffic roadways and the number of lanes in a road segment. In this paper, a novel method of hybrid intelligence is initiated to tackle such uncertainty. Here, the Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine (FCBM) is a stochastic graph model that can learn joint probability distribution over its visible units (say n) and hidden feature units (say m). It is evident that there must be a prime driving parameter of the holistic network, which will monitor the interconnection of weights and biases of the Vehicular Network for all these features. The highlight of this paper is that the prime driving parameter to control the learning process should be a fuzzy number, as fuzzy logic is used to represent the vague and uncertain parameters. Therefore, if uncertainty exists due to the random patterns caused by vehicle mobility, the proposed Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine could remove the noise from the data representation. Thus, the proposed model will be able to predict robustly the mobility in VANET, referring any instance of link failure under Vehicular Network paradigm.

               	   	A fundamental problem in the design of closed-loop Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is in accurately capturing the dynamics of the underlying physical system. To provide optimal control for such closed-loop systems, model-based controls require accurate physical plant models. It is hard to analytically establish (a) how data quality from sensors affects model accuracy, and consequently, (b) the effect of model accuracy on the operational cost of model-based controllers. We present the Model-IQ toolbox which, given a plant model and real input data, automatically evaluates the effect of this uncertainty propagation from sensor data to model accuracy to controller performance. We apply the Model-IQ uncertainty analysis for model-based controls in buildings to demonstrate the cost-benefit of adding temporary sensors to capture a building model. We show how sensor placement and density bias training data. For the real building considered, a bias of 1% degrades model accuracy by 20%. Model-IQ's automated process lowers the cost of sensor deployment, model training and evaluation of advanced controls for small and medium sized buildings. Such end-to-end analysis of uncertainty propagation has the potential to lower the cost for CPS with closed-loop model based control. We demonstrate this with real building data in the Department of Energy's HUB.

                           or not an unsafe state can be reached from a certain configuration of a hybrid system. NSC
                           has very high accuracy, yet it is prone to prediction errors that can affect system safety.
                           To overcome this limitation, we present a method, based on the theory of conformal
                           prediction, that complements NSC predictions with statistically sound estimates of prediction
                           uncertainty. This results in a principled criterion to reject potentially erroneous
                           predictions a priori, i.e., without knowing the true reachability values. Our approach is
                           highly efficient (with runtimes in the order of milliseconds) and effective, managing in our
                           experiments to successfully reject almost all the wrong NSC predictions.

                           The problem of building statistical models of cyber-physical systems using operational data
                           is addressed in this paper, using thecase study of aircraft engines. These models serve as a
                           complementto physics-based models, which may not accurately reflect the operational
                           performance of systems. The accurate modeling of fuelflow rate is an essential aspect of
                           analyzing aircraft engine performance. In this paper, operational data from Flight Data
                           Recordersare used to model the fuel flow rate. The independent variablesare restricted to
                           those which are obtainable from trajectory data.Treating the engine as a statistical system,
                           an algorithm based onGaussian Process Regression (GPR) is developed to estimate thefuel flow
                           rate during the airborne phases of flight. The algorithmpropagates the uncertainty in the
                           estimates in order to determineprediction intervals. The proposed GPR models are evaluated
                           fortheir predictive performance on an independent set of flights. Theresulting estimates are
                           also compared with those given by the Baseof Aircraft Data (BADA) model, which is widely used
                           in aircraftperformance studies. The GPR models are shown to perform statistically
                           significantly better than the BADA model. The GPR modelsalso provide interval estimates for
                           the fuel flow rate which reflectthe variability seen in the data, presenting a promising
                           approachfor data-driven modeling of cyber-physical systems.

                              As software applications become highly interconnected in dynamically provisioned platforms, they form the so-called systems-of-systems. Therefore, a key issue that arises in such environments is whether specific requirements are violated, when these applications interact in new unforeseen ways as new resources or system components are dynamically provisioned. Such environments require the continuous use of frameworks for assessing compliance against specific mission critical system requirements. Such frameworks should be able to (a) handle large requirements models, (b) assess system compliance repeatedly and frequently using events from possibly high velocity and high frequency data streams, and (c) use models that can reflect the vagueness that inherently exists in big data event collection and in modeling dependencies between components of complex and dynamically re-configured systems. In this paper, we introduce a framework for run time reasoning over medium and large-scale fuzzy goal models, and we propose a process which allows for the parallel evaluation of such models. The approach has been evaluated for time and space performance on large goal models, exhibiting that in a simulation environment, the parallel reasoning process offers significant performance improvement over a sequential one.                </td>

                           Control-system robustness verification with respect to implementation aspects lacks automated verification approaches for checking stability and performance of uncertain control systems, when considering finite word-length (FWL) effects. Here we describe and evaluate novel verification procedures for digital systems with uncertainties, based on software model checking and satisfiability modulo theories, named as DSVerifier v2.0, which is able to check robust stability of closed-loop control systems with respect to FWL effects. In particular, we describe our verification algorithms to check for limit-cycle oscillations (LCOs), output quantization error, and robust non-fragile stability on common closed-loop associations of digital control systems (i.e., series and feedback). DSVerifier v2.0 model checks new properties of closed-loop systems (e.g., LCO), including stability and output quantization error for uncertain plant models, and considers unknown parameters and FWL effects. Experimental results over a large set of benchmarks show that 35%, 34%, and 41% of success can be reached for stability, LCO, and output quantization error verification procedures, respectively, for a set of 396 closed-loop control system implementations and realizations.                </td>

And then, an adaptive sliding mode controller is synthesized with different robust terms for different modes to guarantee the reachability of the specified sliding surface. Moreover, the sufficient conditions for the stability of the closed-loop systems are derived.

            Localization underwater has been known to be challenging due to the limited accessibility of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to obtain absolute positions. This becomes more severe in the under-ice environment since the ocean surface is covered with ice, making it more difficult to access GPS or to deploy localization infrastructure. In this paper, a novel solution that minimizes localization uncertainty and communication overhead of under-ice Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is proposed. Existing underwater localization solutions generally rely on reference nodes at ocean surface or on localization infrastructure to calculate positions, and they are not able to estimate the localization uncertainty, which may lead to the increase of localization error. In contrast, using the notion of external uncertainty (i.e., the position uncertainty as seen by others), our solution can characterize an AUV’s position with a probability model. This model is further used to estimate the uncertainty associated with our proposed localization techniques. Based on this uncertainty estimate, we further propose algorithms to minimize localization uncertainty and communication overhead. Our solution is emulated and compared against existing solutions, showing improved performance.                </td>

                              Predicting traffic flow is one of the fundamental needs to comfortable travel, but this task is challenging in vehicular cyber–physical systems because of ever-increasing uncertain traffic big data. Although deep-learning (DL) methods with outstanding performance recently have become popular, most existing DL models for traffic flow prediction are fully deterministic and shed no light on data uncertainty. In this study, a novel fuzzy deep-learning approach called FDCN is proposed for predicting citywide traffic flow. This approach is built on the fuzzy theory and the deep residual network model. Our key idea is to introduce the fuzzy representation into the DL model to lessen the impact of data uncertainty. A model of fuzzy deep convolutional network is established to improve traffic flow prediction while investigating the spatial and temporal correlation of traffic flow. We further propose pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that efficiently learn parameters of the FDCN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a fuzzy DL approach has been applied to represent traffic features for traffic flow prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach to traffic flow prediction has superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.                </td>

                     Long-lived, non-stop cyber-physical systems (CPS) are subject to evolutionary changes that can undermine the guarantees of schedulability that were verified at the time of deployment. At the same time, knowledge gleamed from extended periods of execution can be exploited to reduce the uncertainties that were inevitably presented in the system models that are used to define the temporal behaviours of the control tasks. In this paper we utilise this knowledge and present an adaptation method that actively extends the period of control tasks at run-time based on historical measurements. This can lead to lower power consumption or to the accommodation of increased computation resource demands from other components of the CPS. The method relies on online monitoring and model-based prediction to degrade control performance while having a minimal and acceptable impact on ongoing operations. Cloud-based computing is used to facilitate decision making and offload the local computation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method through control-scheduling co-simulation.                </td>

                This paper considers a synthetic counter-measure, combining transmission scheduling and defensive deception, to defend against jamming attacks in remote state estimation. In the setup studied, an attacker sabotages packet transmissions from a sensor to a remote estimator by congesting the communication channel between them. In order to efficiently degrade the estimation accuracy, the intelligent attacker tailors its jamming strategy by reacting to the real-time information it collects. In response to the jamming attacks, the sensor with a long-term goal will select the transmission power level at each stage. In addition, by modifying the real-time information intentionally, the sensor creates asymmetric uncertainty to mislead the attacker and thus mitigate attacks. Considering the dynamic nature of the process, we model the strategic interaction between the sensor and the attacker by a general stochastic game with asymmetric information structure. To obtain stationary optimal strategies for each player, we convert this game into a belief-based dynamic game and analyze the existence of its optimal solution. For a tractable implementation, we present an algorithm that finds equilibrium strategies based on multi-agent reinforcement learning for symmetric-information stochastic games. Numerical examples illustrate properties of the proposed algorithm.

               	   	Changing production systems and product requirements can trace their origin in volatile customer behaviour and evolving product requirements. This dynamic nature of customer requirements has been described as a constantly moving target, thus presenting a significant challenge for several aspects of product development. To deal with this constant and sometimes unpredictable product evolution, cyber physical production systems (CPPS) that employ condition monitoring, self-awareness and reconfigurability principles, have to be designed and implemented. This research contributes a CPPS design approach that proactively provides the required CPPS design knowledge. This approach aims to minimise or avoids future consequences and disruptions on the CPPS. This knowledge needs to be provided at the right time whilst not being intrusive to the production system designer’s cognitive activity. To effectively deal with the complexity of the cyber physical production system design activity with a manual method would lead to a time consuming, and complex support tool which is hard to implement, and difficult to use. The CPPS design approach has therefore been implemented in a prototype digital factory tool. This paper describes in detail the system requirements and system architecture for this tool. In order to establish the effectiveness of the proposed approach for designing cyber physical production systems, the prototype digital factory tool has been evaluated with a case study and a number of semi-structured interviews with both industrial and scientific stakeholders. The encouraging results obtained from this research evaluation have shown that such an approach for supporting the CPPS design activity makes stakeholders aware of their decision consequences and is useful in practice. This result can lead the way for the development and integration of such knowledge-based decision-making approaches within state-of-the-art digital factory and Computer Aided Engineering Design (CAED) tools.

               	   	Industry 4.0 is widely accepted in manufacturing industry since it guides a novel and promising production paradigm. A new characteristic in Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems is that the applications of advanced intelligent machines which have communication, self-optimization and self-training behaviors. Based on this new change, this study investigates a flow-shop scheduling problem under the consideration of multiple objectives, time-dependent processing time and uncertainty. A mixed integer programming model is formulated for this problem, and a fireworks algorithm is developed where some special strategies are designed, e.g., explosion sparks procedure and selection solution procedure. Simulation experiments on a set of test problems are carried out, and the experimental results demonstrate that the model and proposed algorithm can achieve a satisfactory performance by comparing with three state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms.

A fully distributed adaptive leaderless consensus control strategy is proposed to deal with the sensor and actuator attacks. Compared with existing results in which the model considered is simple, a strict-feedback nonlinear system is considered in this paper, which makes the problem more challenging. It is shown that all closed-loop signals are uniformly bounded and asymptotic output consensus is achieved in presence of sensor and actuator attacks.

               	   	Power cyber-physical systems (PCPSs) are becoming increasingly complex and diverse, benefitting from all aspects of societal issues. A PCPS is a next-generation system that is a tight conjunction of computation, communication, control, and power systems. The integration of Internet of Things and PCPS generates a novel energy system, the Internet of Energy, which is the future of the energy system. In the same way, the connection of bulk components and the extensive communications among them has brought many insecurities, uncertainties, and security challenges. Thus, a study of the analysis and synthesis of the reliability and security of PCPS is presented in this paper. By considering the unsafe uncertainties, models are formulated for a general cyber-attack, and a double-loop architecture for security defense is designed. According to this framework, security control scenarios are obtained from the character of each kind of cyber-attack. Finally, a separately excited dc motor with uncertainty is used as an example to demonstrate the problem.

               	   	Programming embedded and cyber-physical systems requires attention not only to functional behavior and correctness, but also to non-functional aspects and specifically timing and performance. A structured, compositional, model-based approach based on stepwise refinement and abstraction techniques can support the development process, increase its quality and reduce development time through automation of synthesis, analysis or verification. Toward this, we introduce a theory of timed actors whose notion of refinement is based on the principle of worst-case design that permeates the world of performance-critical systems. This is in contrast with the classical behavioral and functional refinements based on restricting sets of behaviors. Our refinement allows time-deterministic abstractions to be made of time-non-deterministic systems, improving efficiency and reducing complexity of formal analysis. We show how our theory relates to, and can be used to reconcile existing time and performance models and their established theories.

               	   	This article is a tutorial on how to achieve software evolution and adaptation in a dependable manner, by systematically applying formal modelling and verification. It shows how software can be designed upfront to tolerate different sources of uncertainty that cause continuous future changes. If possible changes can be predicted, and their occurrence can be detected, it is possible to design the software to be self-adaptable. Otherwise, continuous evolution has to be supported and continuous flow into operation has to be ensured. In cases where systems are designed to be continuously running, it is necessary to support safe continuous software deployment that guarantees correct operation in the presence of dynamic reconfigurations. The approaches we survey here have been mainly developed in the context of the SMScom project, funded by the European Commission –Programme IDEAS-ERC (http://erc-smscom.dei.polimi.it/.) – and lead by the author. It is argued that these approaches fit well the current agile methods for development and operations that are popularized as DevOps.

               	   	The cyber-physical systems of Industry 4.0 are expected to generate vast amount of in-process data and revolutionise the way data, knowledge and wisdom is captured and reused in manufacturing industries. The goal is to increase profits by dramatically reducing the occurrence of unexpected process results and waste. ISO9001:2015 defines risk as effect of uncertainty. In the 7Epsilon context, the risk is defined as effect of uncertainty on expected results. The paper proposes a novel algorithm to embed risk based thinking in quantifying uncertainty in manufacturing operations during the tolerance synthesis process. This method uses penalty functions to mathematically represent deviation from expected results and solves the tolerance synthesis problem by proposing a quantile regression tree approach. The latter involves non parametric estimation of conditional quantiles of a response variable from in-process data and allows process engineers to discover and visualise optimal ranges that are associated with quality improvements. In order to quantify uncertainty and predict process robustness, a probabilistic approach, based on the likelihood ratio test with bootstrapping, is proposed which uses smoothed probability estimation of conditional probabilities. The mathematical formulation presented in this paper will allow organisations to extend Six Sigma process improvement principles in the Industry 4.0 context and implement the 7 steps of 7Epsilon in order to satisfy the requirements of clauses 6.1 and 7.1.6 of the ISO9001:2015 and the aerospace AS9100:2016 quality standard.

							This paper develops a sampled-data (SD) controller for uncertain multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, possibly with non-minimum phase zeros, using the L1 adaptive control architecture. The proposed controller compensates for disturbances and uncertainties within the bandwidth of a low-pass filter. Sufficient conditions for robust stability are obtained for the closed-loop system with SD controller, where the input/output signals are held constant over a sampling period. It is shown that the hybrid closed-loop system can recover the performance of a continuous-time reference system as the sampling time of the SD controller tends to zero. Simulation examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings.

							Medical cyber-physical systems, such as the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), require evaluation of safety and efficacy in the context of a patient population in a clinical trial. Advances in computer modeling and simulation allow for generation of a simulated cohort or virtual cohort which mimics a patient population and can be used as a source of prior information. A major obstacle to acceptance of simulation results as a source of prior information is the lack of a framework for explicitly modeling sources of uncertainty in simulation results and quantifying the effect on trial outcomes.In this work, we formulate the Computer-Aided Clinical Trial (CACT) within a Bayesian statistical framework allowing explicit modeling of assumptions and utilization of simulation results at all stages of a clinical trial. To quantify the robustness of the CACT outcome with respect to a simulation assumption, we define δ-robustness as the minimum perturbation of the base prior distribution resulting in a change of the CACT outcome and provide a method to estimate the δ-robustness.We demonstrate the utility of the framework and how the results of δ-robustness evaluation can be utilized at various stages of a clinical trial through an application to the Rhythm ID Goes Head-to-head Trial (RIGHT), which was a comparative evaluation of the safety and efficacy of specific software algorithms across different implantable cardiac devices. Finally, we introduce a hardware interface that allows for direct interaction with the physical device in order to validate and confirm the results of a CACT for implantable cardiac devices.

							Cyber-physical systems are often hybrid consisting of both discrete and continuous subsystems. The continuous dynamics in cyber-physical systems could be noisy and the environment in which these stochastic hybrid systems operate can also be uncertain. We focus on multimodal hybrid systems in which the switching from one mode to another is determined by a schedule and the optimal finite horizon control problem is to discover the switching schedule as well as the control inputs to be applied in each mode such that some cost metric is minimized over the given horizon. We consider discrete-time control in this paper. We present a two step approach to solve this problem with respect to convex cost objectives and probabilistic safety properties. Our approach uses a combination of sample average approximation and convex programming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on case studies from temperature-control in buildings and motion planning.

							Autonomous vehicles have found wide-ranging adoption in aerospace, terrestrial as well as marine use. These systems often operate in uncertain environments and in the presence of noisy sensors, and use machine learning and statistical sensor fusion algorithms to form an internal model of the world that is inherently probabilistic. Autonomous vehicles need to operate using this uncertain world-model, and hence, their correctness cannot be deterministically specified. Even once probabilistic correctness is specified, proving that an autonomous vehicle will operate correctly is a challenging problem. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a correct-by-synthesis approach to autonomous vehicle control. We propose a probabilistic extension of temporal logic, named Chance Constrained Temporal Logic (C2TL), that can be used to specify correctness requirements in presence of uncertainty. C2TL extends temporal logic by including chance constraints as predicates in the formula which allows modeling of perception uncertainty while retaining its ease of reasoning. We present a novel automated synthesis technique that compiles C2TL specification into mixed integer constraints, and uses second-order (quadratic) cone programming to synthesize optimal control of autonomous vehicles subject to the C2TL specification. We also present a risk distribution approach that enables synthesis of plans with lower cost without increasing the overall risk. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a diverse set of illustrative examples.

						Program variables used in robotic and cyber-physical systems often have implicit physical units that cannot be determined from their variable types. Inferring an abstract physical unit type for variables and checking their physical unit type consistency is of particular importance for validating the correctness of such systems. For instance, a variable with the unit of ‘meter’ should not be assigned to another variable with the unit of ‘degree-per-second’. Existing solutions have various limitations such as requiring developers to annotate variables with physical units and only handling variables that are directly or transitively used in popular robotic libraries with known physical unit information. We observe that there are a lot of physical unit hints in these softwares such as variable names and specific forms of expressions. These hints have uncertainty as developers may not respect conventions. We propose to model them with probability distributions and conduct probabilistic inference. At the end, our technique produces a unit distribution for each variable. Unit inconsistencies can then be detected using the highly probable unit assignments. Experimental results on 30 programs show that our technique can infer units for 159.3% more variables compared to the state-of-the-art with more than 88.7% true positives, and inconsistencies detection on 90 programs shows that our technique reports 103.3% more inconsistencies with 85.3% true positives.

               	   		The integration of physical systems through computing and networking has become pervasive, a trend now known as cyber-physical systems (CPS). Functionality in CPS emerges from the interaction of networked computational and physical objects. System design and integration are particularly challenging because fundamentally different physical and computational design concerns intersect. The impact of these interactions is the loss of compositionality which creates tremendous challenges. The key idea in this article is to use passivity for decoupling the control design of networked systems from uncertainties such as time delays and packet loss, thus providing a fundamental simplification strategy that limits the complexity of interactions. The main contribution is the application of the approach to an experimental case study of a networked multi-robot system. We present a networked control architecture that ensures the overall system remains stable in spite of implementation uncertainties such as network delays and data dropouts, focusing on the technical details required for the implementation. We describe a prototype domain-specific modeling language and automated code generation tools for the design of networked control systems on top of passivity that facilitate effective system configuration, deployment, and testing. Finally, we present experimental evaluation results that show decoupling of interlayer interactions.

               	   	This paper systematically deals with robust consensus of uncertain linear multi-agent systems via dynamic output-feedback protocols. Agents are assumed to have identical nominal linear time-invariant dynamics but are subject to heterogeneous additive stable perturbations. Dynamic output-feedback protocols with or without controller state information exchange between neighboring controllers are studied in a unified framework. Two methods are proposed for protocol design, which need to solve an algebraic Riccati equation and some scalar/matrix inequalities. The first method characterizes some key parameters by scalar inequalities related to the nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian, which requires the diagonalizability of the Laplacian, while the second method characterizes the parameters by linear matrix inequalities, which circumvents the requirement of the diagonalizability of the Laplacian. Compared with existing results, the proposed approach can simultaneously cope with heterogeneous uncertainties and directed communication graphs. Numerical results verify the advantages of the proposed design methods.

Probabilistic optimal power flow (OPF) analysis is required to accomplish the electrical and economic operational goals. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to accelerate the computation of probabilistic OPF for large-scale smart grids through network reduction (NR). Cumulant-based method and Gram-Charlier expansion theory are used to efficiently obtain the statistics of system states. We develop a more accurate linear mapping method to compute the unknown cumulants. Our method speeds up the computation by up to 4.57X and can improve around 30% accuracy when Hessian matrix is ill-conditioned compared to the previous approach.

               	   Self-healing cyber-physical systems (SH-CPSs) detect and recover from faults by themselves at runtime. Testing such systems is challenging due to the complex implementation of self-healing behaviors and their interaction with the physical environment, both of which are uncertain. To this end, we propose an executable model-based approach to test self-healing behaviors under environmental uncertainties. The approach consists of a Modeling Framework of SH-CPSs (MoSH) and an accompanying Test Model Executor (TM-Executor). MoSH provides a set of modeling constructs and a methodology to specify executable test models, which capture expected system behaviors and environmental uncertainties. TM-Executor executes the test models together with the systems under test, to dynamically test their self-healing behaviors under uncertainties. We demonstrated the successful application of MoSH to specify 11 self-healing behaviors and 17 uncertainties for three SH-CPSs. The time spent by TM-Executor to perform testing activities was in the order of milliseconds, though the time spent was strongly correlated with the complexity of test models.

               	   Self-healing is becoming an essential behavior of smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), which enables them to recover from faults by themselves. Such behaviors make decisions autonomously at runtime and they often operate in an uncertain physical environment making testing even more challenging. To this end, we propose Fragility-Oriented Testing (FOT), which relies on model execution and reinforcement learning to cost-effectively test self-healing behaviors of CPSs in the presence of environmental uncertainty. We evaluated FOT’s performance by comparing it with a Coverage-Oriented Testing (COT) algorithm. Evaluation results show that FOT significantly outperformed COT for testing nine self-healing behaviors implemented in three case studies. On average, FOT managed to find 80% more faults than COT and for cases when both FOT and COT found the same faults, FOT took on average 50% less time than COT.

                                This paper develops a model-based framework for the quantification and propagation of multiple uncertainty sources affecting the performance of a smart system. A smart system, in general, performs sensing, control and actuation for proper functioning of a physical subsystem (also referred to as a plant). With strong feedback coupling between several subsystems, the uncertainty in the quantities of interest (QoI) amplifies over time. The coupling in a generic smart system occurs at two levels: (1) coupling between individual subsystems (plant, cyber, actuation, sensors), and (2) coupling between nodes in a distributed computational subsystem. In this paper, a coupled smart system is decoupled and considered as a feed-forward system over time and modeled using a two-level Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), one at each level of coupling (between subsystems and between nodes). A DBN can aggregate uncertainty from multiple sources within a time step and across time steps. The DBN associated with a smart system can be learned using available system models, physics models and data. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for the design of a smart indoor heating system (identification of sensors and a wireless network) within cost constraints that enables room-by-room temperature control. We observe that sensor uncertainty has a higher impact on the performance of the heating system compared to the uncertainty in the wireless network.

               	   			Distributed fault diagnosis has been proposed as an effective technique for monitoring large scale, nonlinear and uncertain systems. It is based on the decomposition of the large scale system into a number of interconnected subsystems, each one monitored by a dedicated Local Fault Detector (LFD). Neighboring LFDs, in order to successfully account for subsystems interconnection, are thus required to communicate with each other some of the measurements from their subsystems. Anyway, such communication may expose private information of a given subsystem, such as its local input. To avoid this problem, we propose here to use differential privacy to pre-process data before transmission.

               	   			Designing secure cyber-physical systems (CPS) is a particularly difficult task since security vulnerabilities stem not only from traditional cybersecurity concerns, but also physical ones. Many of the standard methods for CPS design make strong and unverified assumptions about the trustworthiness of physical devices, such as sensors. When these assumptions are violated, subtle inter-domain vulnerabilities are introduced into the system model. In this paper we use formal specification of analysis contracts to expose security assumptions and guarantees of analyses from reliability, control, and sensor security domains. We show that this specification allows us to determine where these assumptions are violated, opening the door to malicious attacks. We demonstrate how this approach can help discover and prevent vulnerabilities using a self-driving car example.

               	   			A cyber-physical system (CPS) comprises several connected, embedded systems and is additionally equipped with sensors and actuators. Thus, CPSs can communicate with their cyber environment and measure and interact with their physical environment. Due to the complexity of their operational environment, assumptions the manufacturer have made may not hold in operation. During an unforeseen environmental situation, a CPS may expose behavior that negatively impactsits reliability. This may arise due to insufficiently considered environmental conditions during the design of a CPS, or – even worse – it is impossible to anticipate such conditions. In the U-Test project, we are developing a configurable search-based testing framework that exploits information from functional testing and from declarative descriptions of uncertainties. Itaims at revealing unintended behavior in the presence of uncertainties. This framework enables testing for different scenarios of uncertainty and thus, allows to achieve a certain coverage of those, and to find unknown uncertainty scenarios.

                                Acceptance testing validates that a system meets its requirements and determines whether it can be sufficiently trusted and put into operation. For cyber physical systems (CPS), acceptance testing is a hardware-in-the-loop process conducted in a (near-)operational environment. Acceptance testing of a CPS often necessitates that the test cases be prioritized, as there are usually too many scenarios to consider given time constraints. CPS acceptance testing is further complicated by the uncertainty in the environment and the impact of testing on hardware. We propose an automated test case prioritization approach for CPS acceptance testing, accounting for time budget constraints, uncertainty, and hardware damage risks. Our approach is based on multi-objective search, combined with a test case minimization algorithm that eliminates redundant operations from an ordered sequence of test cases. We evaluate our approach on a representative case study from the satellite domain. The results indicate that, compared to test cases that are prioritized manually by satellite engineers, our automated approach more than doubles the number of test cases that fit into a given time frame, while reducing to less than one third the number of operations that entail the risk of damage to key hardware components.

                                Structured and unstructured uncertainties together with external disturbances may pose considerable challenges in realizing desired path-tacking and lane keeping of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a novel robust adaptive indirect control method based on an exponential-like-sliding-mode fuzzy type-2 neural network approach for enhanced path-tracking performance of road autonomous vehicles subject to parametric uncertainties related to vehicle nominal cornering stiffness, road-tire adhesion coefficient, inertial parameters, and forward speed. A hierarchical controller is designed and the stability of the closed-loop system is ensured along with deriving the adaptation laws by employing the Lyapunov stability theorem. The conventional reaching law related to the sliding mode degrades from the system stability and introduces an inherent chattering of the controller input. The convergence law for the sliding surface is adjusted based on a variable exponential sliding manifold to eliminate possible chattering in the buffeting switch zone near the origin. The proposed exponential-like sliding surface guarantees the swift and smooth global asymptotic convergence of the tracking error toward zero. Furthermore, an adaptive look-ahead path-tracking error term is introduced as an auxiliary error criterion to improve the vehicle path-tracking performance. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified through Matlab/Simulink–CarSim co-simulations and comparisons with selected reported control methods for two different road maneuvers. The results suggested substantially improved tracking performance by the proposed controller with robustness to withstand against the perturbed parameters and external disturbances.

                                Many Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are composed of low-cost devices that are deeply integrated with physical environments. As a result, the performance of a CPS system is inevitably undermined by various physical uncertainties, which include stochastic noises, hardware biases, unpredictable environment changes, and dynamics of the physical process of interest. Traditional solutions to these issues (e.g., device calibration and collaborative signal processing) work in an open-loop fashion and hence often fail to adapt to the uncertainties after system deployment. In this article, we propose an adaptive system-level calibration approach for a class of CPS systems whose primary objective is to detect events or targets of interest. Through collaborative data fusion, our calibration approach features a feedback control loop that exploits system heterogeneity to mitigate the impact of aforementioned uncertainties on the system performance. In contrast to existing heuristic-based solutions, our control-theoretical calibration algorithm can ensure provable system stability and convergence. We also develop a routing algorithm for fusion-based multihop CPS systems that is robust to communication unreliability and delay. Our approach is evaluated by both experiments on a testbed of Tmotes as well as extensive simulations based on data traces gathered from a real vehicle detection experiment. The results demonstrate that our calibration algorithm enables a CPS system to maintain the optimal sensing performance in the presence of various system and environmental dynamics.

                                Today's cyber-physical systems (CPS) span IoT and cloud-based datacenter infrastructures, which are highly heterogeneous with various types of uncertainty. Thus, testing uncertainties in these CPS is a challenging and multidisciplinary activity. We need several tools for modeling, deployment, control, and analytics to test and evaluate uncertainties for different configurations of the same CPS. In this paper, we explain why using state-of-the art model-driven engineering (MDE) and model-based testing (MBT) tools is not adequate for testing uncertainties of CPS in IoT Cloud infrastructures. We discus how to combine them with techniques for elastic execution to dynamically provision both CPS under test and testing utilities to perform tests in various IoT Cloud infrastructures.

                                In this paper, we present a new tool SReach, which solves probabilistic bounded reachability problems for two classes of models of stochastic hybrid systems. The first one is (nonlinear) hybrid automata with parametric uncertainty. The second one is probabilistic hybrid automata with additional randomness for both transition probabilities and variable resets. Standard approaches to reachability problems for linear hybrid systems require numerical solutions for large optimization problems, and become infeasible for systems involving both nonlinear dynamics over the reals and stochasticity. SReach encodes stochastic information by using a set of introduced random variables, and combines  \(\delta \) -complete decision procedures and statistical tests to solve  \(\delta \) -reachability problems in a sound manner. Compared to standard simulation-based methods, it supports non-deterministic branching, increases the coverage of simulation, and avoids the zero-crossing problem. We demonstrate SReach’s applicability by discussing three representative biological models and additional benchmarks for nonlinear hybrid systems with multiple probabilistic system parameters.

Researchers investigated the possibility of integrating energy management systems with cyber-physical systems to form energy-cyber-physical systems in order to promote building energy management. However, minimizing energy consumption while fulfilling building functions for energy-cyber-physical systems is challenging due to the dynamics of building occupants. As occupant behavior is a major source of uncertainty for energy management, ignoring it often results in both energy waste caused by overheating and overcooling as well as discomfort due to insufficient thermal and ventilation services. To mitigate such uncertainties, this study proposes an occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical system that incorporates WiFi probe-based occupancy detection. The proposed framework utilizes ensemble classification algorithms to extract three forms of occupancy information. It creates a data interface to link energy management systems and cyber-physical systems and allows for automated occupancy detection and interpretation by assembling multiple weak classifiers for WiFi signals. A validation experiment in a large office room was conducted to examine the performance of the proposed occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical systems. The experiment and simulation results suggest that, with a proper classifier and occupancy data type, the proposed model can potentially save about 26.4% of energy consumption in cooling and ventilation demands.

                              In complex cyber-physical system operations, fault detection needs to be performed using limited state information for practicality and privacy concerns. While a well-designed observation can distinguish a faulty behavior from the normal behavior, it can also represent the action of hiding some of the state information or discrete mode switchings. In this paper, we present a method for constructing the observation maps in the form of metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas that can be formally proven to detect fault in a switched system, while preserving certain privacy conditions. We provide a theoretical framework of robust temporal logic inference for classification of switched system trajectories with spatial and temporal uncertainties. We simulate finitely many nominal trajectories and use the robust neighborhoods around the simulated trajectories to cover the infinite trajectories that constitute the system behavior. Thus, the designed observation maps with the inferred MTL formulas can detect fault and preserve privacy in a provably correct fashion. Our approach is implemented on the simulation model of a smart building testbed to detect thermal leakage in the room, while preserving multiple privacy conditions of the room occupancy.

                            The intelligent manufacturing strategy and customer demand have mutually promoted each other. Also, the production mode is shifting towards customized production, and more rental resources or services are introduced to the production system, therefore, the systems are becoming more complex. Compared with traditional production systems, such systems have some new features, this work calls this type of system as a synchronized production operation system (SPOS). Under such circumstances, production systems are influenced by more frequent uncertainties, and the planning-based production decision and control approach is no longer applicable. The opti-state control (OsC) method is proposed to help SPOS keep in an optimal state when uncertainties affect the system. Besides, a digital twin-based control framework (DTCF) is designed for getting the full element information needed for decision making. Based on the comprehensive information of the production system obtained by the DTCF, the OsC method is introduced to the virtual control layer to formulate the optimal target guiding the path of the system in real time through the dynamic matching mechanism (qualitative perspective). Then multi-stage synchronized control with analysis target cascading (ATC) method is used to get the local optimal state decisions (quantitative perspective). From both qualitative and quantitative aspects to ensure the system is under an optimal target path for optimal operation procedure. At last, a case study in a large-size paint making company in China is used to validate the effectiveness of the approach.

                            Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) typically operate in highly indeterminate environmental conditions, which require the development of testing methods that must explicitly consider uncertainty in test design, test generation, and test optimization. Towards this direction, we propose a set of uncertainty-wise test case generation and test case minimization strategies that rely on test ready models explicitly specifying subjective uncertainty. We propose two test case generation strategies and four test case minimization strategies based on the Uncertainty Theory and multi-objective search. These strategies include a novel methodology for designing and introducing indeterminacy sources in the environment during test execution and a novel set of uncertainty-wise test verdicts. We performed an extensive empirical study to select the best algorithm out of eight commonly used multi-objective search algorithms, for each of the four minimization strategies, with five use cases of two industrial CPS case studies. The minimized set of test cases obtained with the best algorithm for each minimization strategy were executed on the two real CPSs. The results showed that our best test strategy managed to observe 51% more uncertainties due to unknown indeterminate behaviors of the physical environments of the CPSs as compared to the other test strategies. Also, the same test strategy managed to observe 118% more unknown uncertainties as compared to the unique number of known uncertainties.

                            Context
														Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), when deployed for operation, are inherently prone to uncertainty. Considering their applications in critical domains (e.g., healthcare), it is important that such CPSs are tested sufficiently, with the explicit consideration of uncertainty. Model-based testing (MBT) involves creating test ready models capturing the expected behavior of a CPS and its operating environment. These test ready models are then used for generating executable test cases. It is, therefore, necessary to develop methods that can continuously evolve, based on real operational data collected during the operation of CPSs, test ready models and uncertainty captured in them, all together termed as Belief Test Ready Models (BMs)
														Objective
														Our objective is to propose a model evolution framework that can interactively improve the quality of BMs, based on operational data. Such BMs are developed by one or more test modelers (belief agents) with their assumptions about the expected behavior of a CPS, its expected physical environment, and potential future deployments. Thus, these models explicitly contain subjective uncertainty of the test modelers.
														Method
														We propose a framework (named as UncerTolve) for interactively evolving BMs (specified with extended UML notations) of CPSs with subjective uncertainty developed by test modelers. The key inputs of UncerTolve include initial BMs of CPSs with known subjective uncertainty and real data collected from the operation of CPSs. UncerTolve has three key features: 1) Validating the syntactic correctness and conformance of BMs against real operational data via model execution, 2) Evolving objective uncertainty measurements of BMs via model execution, and 3) Evolving state invariants (modeling test oracles) and guards of transitions (modeling constraints for test data generation) of BMs with a machine learning technique.
														Results
														As a proof-of-concept, we evaluated UncerTolve with one industrial CPS case study, i.e., GeoSports from the healthcare domain. Using UncerTolve, we managed to evolve 51% of belief elements, 18% of states, and 21% of transitions as compared to the initial BM developed in an industrial setting.
														Conclusion
														UncerTolve can successfully evolve model elements of the initial BM, in addition to objective uncertainty measurements using real operational data. The evolved model can be used to generate additional test cases covering evolved model elements and objective uncertainty. These additional test cases can be used to test the current and future deployments of a CPS to ensure that it will handle uncertainty gracefully during its operations.

                            It is important that a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with uncertainty in its behavior caused by its unpredictable operating environment, to ensure its reliable operation. One method to ensure that the CPS will handle such uncertainty during its operation is by testing the CPS with model-based testing (MBT) techniques. However, existing MBT techniques do not explicitly capture uncertainty in test ready models, i.e., capturing the uncertain expected behavior of a CPS in the presence of environment uncertainty. To fill this gap, we present an Uncertainty-Wise test-modeling framework, named as UncerTum, to create test ready models to support MBT of CPSs facing uncertainty. UncerTum relies on the definition of a UML profile [the UML Uncertainty Profile (UUP)] and a set of UML Model Libraries extending the UML profile for Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems (MARTE). UncerTum also benefits from the UML Testing Profile V.2 to support standard-based MBT. UncerTum was evaluated with two industrial CPS case studies, one real-world case study, and one open-source CPS case study from the following four perspectives: (1) Completeness and Coverage of the profiles and Model Libraries in terms of concepts defined in their underlying uncertainty conceptual model for CPSs, i.e., U-Model and MARTE, (2) Effort required to model uncertainty with UncerTum, and (3) Correctness of the developed test ready models, which was assessed via model execution. Based on the evaluation, we can conclude that we were successful in modeling all the uncertainties identified in the four case studies, which gives us an indication that UncerTum is sufficiently complete. In terms of modeling effort, we concluded that on average UncerTum requires 18.5% more time to apply stereotypes from UUP on test ready models.

                            Uncertainty is intrinsic in most technical systems, including Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, handling uncertainty in a graceful manner during the real operation of CPS is critical. Since designing, developing, and testing modern and highly sophisticated CPS is an expanding field, a step towards dealing with uncertainty is to identify, define, and classify uncertainties at various levels of CPS. This will help develop a systematic and comprehensive understanding of uncertainty. To that end, we propose a conceptual model for uncertainty specifically designed for CPS. Since the study of uncertainty in CPS development and testing is still irrelatively unexplored, this conceptual model was derived in a large part by reviewing existing work on uncertainty in other fields, including philosophy, physics, statistics, and healthcare. The conceptual model is mapped to the three logical levels of CPS: Application, Infrastructure, and Integration. It is captured using UML class diagrams, including relevant OCL constraints. To validate the conceptual model, we identified, classified, and specified uncertainties in two distinct industrial case studies.

               	   	    The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices within homes raises many security and privacy concerns. Recent headlines highlight the lack of effective security mechanisms in IoT devices. Security threats in IoT arise not only from vulnerabilities in individual devices but also from the composition of devices in unanticipated ways and the ability of devices to interact through both cyber and physical channels. Existing approaches provide methods for monitoring cyber interactions between devices but fail to consider possible physical interactions. To overcome this challenge, it is essential that security assessments of IoT networks take a holistic view of the network and treat it as a "system of systems", in which security is defined, not solely by the individual systems, but also by the interactions and trust dependencies between systems.
                        In this paper, we propose a way of modeling cyber and physical interactions between IoT devices of a given network. By verifying the cyber and physical interactions against user-defined policies, our model can identify unexpected chains of events that may be harmful. It can also be applied to determine the impact of the addition (or removal) of a device into an existing network with respect to dangerous device interactions.
                        We demonstrate the viability of our approach by instantiating our model using Alloy, a language and tool for relational models. In our evaluation, we considered three realistic IoT use cases and demonstrate that our model is capable of identifying potentially dangerous device interactions. We also measure the performance of our approach with respect to the CPU runtime and memory consumption of the Alloy model finder, and show that it is acceptable for smart-home IoT networks.

               	   	  Internet of Things (IoT) data analytics is underpinning numerous applications, however, the task is still challenging predominantly due to heterogeneous IoT data streams, unreliable networks, and ever increasing size of the data. In this context, we propose a two-layer architecture for analyzing IoT data. The first layer provides a generic interface using a service oriented gateway to ingest data from multiple interfaces and IoT systems, store it in a scalable manner and analyze it in real-time to extract high-level events; whereas second layer is responsible for probabilistic fusion of these high-level events. In the second layer, we extend state-of-the-art event processing using Bayesian networks in order to take uncertainty into account while detecting complex events. We implement our proposed solution using open source components optimized for large-scale applications. We demonstrate our solution on real-world use-case in the domain of intelligent transportation system where we analyzed traffic, weather, and social media data streams from Madrid city in order to predict probability of congestion in real-time. The performance of the system is evaluated qualitatively using a web-interface where traffic administrators can provide the feedback about the quality of predictions and quantitatively using F-measure with an accuracy of over 80%.

               	   	  Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been deployed to monitor network activity and to protect systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices from attacks (or intrusions). The problem with these systems is that they generate a huge amount of inappropriate false alarms whenever abnormal activities are detected and they are not too flexible for a complex environment. The high-level rate of the generated false alarms reduces the performance of IDS against cyber-attacks and makes the tasks of the security analyst particularly difficult and the management of intrusion detection process computationally expensive. We study here one of the challenging aspects of computer and network security and we propose to build a detection model for both known and unknown intrusions (or anomaly detection) via a novel nonparametric Bayesian model. The design of our framework can be extended easily to be adequate for IoT technology and notably for intelligent smart city web-based applications. In our method, we learn the patterns of the activities (both normal and anomalous) through a Bayesian-based MCMC inference for infinite bounded generalized Gaussian mixture models. Contrary to classic clustering methods, our approach does not need to specify the number of clusters, takes into consideration the uncertainty via the introduction of prior knowledge for the parameters of the model, and permits to solve problems related to over- and under-fitting. In order to get better clustering performance, feature weights, model's parameters, and the number of clusters are estimated simultaneously and automatically. The developed approach was evaluated using popular data sets. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in detecting various attacks.

               	   	In the cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) environments, quantifying uncertainty is an important element input to keep the acceptable level of reliability in various configurations. In this paper, we aim to address the pricing model of delivering data over the cloud while taking into consideration the dynamic uncertainty factors such as network topology, transmission/reception energy, nodal charge and power, and computation capacity. These uncertainty factors are mapped to different nodes with varying capabilities to be processed using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms. Accordingly, we aim to find a way to calculate and predict the price per big data service over the cloud using AI and deep learning. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework to address big data delivery issues in cloud-based IoT environments by considering uncertainty factors. We compare the performance of the framework using two AI-based techniques called Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) in both centralized and distributed versions. The use of AI techniques can be applied in multilevel to provide a kind of deep learning to further improve the performance of the system under study. The results reveal that the distributed algorithm outperforms the centralized one. In addition, the results show that the GA has lower running time compared to the SAA in all the test cases such as 68% of improvement in the centralized version, and 66% of improvement in the distributed version in case when the size of uncertainty array is 256. Moreover, when the size of uncertainty array increases, the results show 60% speed up in the distributed GA compared to its centralized version. The improvements achieved would help the service providers to actually improve their profit using the proposed framework.

               	   			As Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical systems become more ubiquitous and an integral part of our daily lives, it is important that we are able to trust the data aggregate from such systems. However, the interpretation of trustworthiness is contextual and varies according to the risk tolerance attitude of the concerned application and varying levels of uncertainty associated with the evidence upon which trust models act. Hence, the data integrity scoring mechanisms should have provisions to adapt to varying risk attitudes and uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian inference model and a prospect theoretic framework for data integrity scoring that quantify the trustworthiness of data collected from IoT devices by a hub in the presence of an adversary manipulating data and an imperfect anomaly monitoring mechanism. The monitoring mechanism monitors the data being sent from each device and classifies the outcome as not compromised, compromised, and cannot be inferred. These outcomes are conceptualized as a multinomial hypothesis of a Bayesian inference model with three parameters which are then used for calculating a utility value on how reliable the aggregate data is. We use prospect theory inspired approach to quantify this data integrity score and evaluate trustworthiness of the aggregate data from the IoT framework. As decisions are based on how the data is fused, we propose two measuring models-one optimistic and another conservative. The proposed framework is validated using extensive simulation experiments. We show how data integrity scores vary under a variety of system factors like attack intensity and inaccurate detection.

                           In many IoT applications, sensor nodes are distributed over a region of interests and collect
                           data at a specified time interval. With the development of hardware, the monitoring tasks
                           become diversity. The specified acquisition strategy can not adaptively adjust the sampling
                           interval. Due to the measurement error and the uncertainty of the environment, equi-frequency
                           sampling technique may result in misunderstandings to the physical world. Based on Taylor
                           expansion and time series analysis, this paper presents a sensed data model. The model can be
                           considered as a unified approach, where linear regression or spline interpolation is a
                           special case of our model. A mathematical method for parameter estimation is proposed, which
                           can minimize the measurement error. And we prove the estimation is unbias. An adaptive data
                           acquisition algorithm is proposed. Performance evaluation on the real data set verifies that
                           the proposed algorithms have high performance in terms of accuracy and effectiveness.

                           Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems are usually composed of thousands of different components
                           among hardware devices and different software modules. In order to address the design of
                           these complex systems, different abstraction layers are usually defined. However, as these
                           layers are isolated, highlevel components always have uncertainty about the nature of the
                           low-level components they relate with. In particular, as low-level component identities are
                           not known by user applications, and current IoT systems are vulnerable to the injection of
                           new components and to the modification of the behavior of existing ones (adequate security
                           solutions at the network level for these problems have not been found yet), the reliability
                           of the received data is generally compromised. In this context, new mechanisms are required
                           to avoid the interactions or directly remove the malicious components relying on high-level
                           information. This paper describes a statistical framework to discover IoT components with
                           malicious behaviors, using a hybrid reputation model. On the one hand, an implicit reputation
                           definition is employed, based on the observations made by a certain IoT component and other
                           modules it relies on. On the other hand, an explicit reputation model considers a scheme of
                           recommendations and negative grades. The proposed solution is evaluated in a simulation
                           scenario by using the NS3 simulator, in order to perform an experimental validation.

                           The emergence of the Internet of Things paves the way for enhancing the monitoring
                           capabilities of enterprises by means of extensive use of physical and virtual sensors
                           generating a multitude of data. The generated real-time data streams provide the basis for
                           anticipating future undesired events and thus enable enterprises to decide and act ahead of
                           time, i.e. in a proactive manner. Proactive information systems can benefit from the use of
                           context-awareness in order to provide more reliable recommendations. In this paper we propose
                           a probabilistic model for context-aware proactive event-driven decision making that deals
                           with the uncertainty that is inherent in the contextual elements' values. We validated our
                           approach in an oil and gas industry scenario and we conducted a comparative analysis.

                           Through digitisation of physical artefacts and environments, the Internet of Things carries
                           vast potential for process innovation. However, navigation of the quickly evolving
                           technological landscape and identification of emerging opportunities for value creation
                           remains challenging. To this end, we combine existing frameworks on information requirements,
                           IT capability, and business value of IT. We evaluate the usability of these frameworks for
                           IoT enabled innovation in our analysis of two sensor-based process innovation projects. We
                           investigate the fit between process characteristics and technological functionality, and the
                           implications of this alignment. Our analysis demonstrates that the framework provides a
                           practically useful and theoretically coherent conceptual device for analyzing process
                           characteristics and digital options to innovate processes. Furthermore, we find that IoT
                           sensors are well suited to address connectivity and uncertainty requirements. However, in
                           order to leverage them to address high equivocality requirements designers need deep
                           contextual understanding to align IoT capability with information requirements.

                              With the significant advancements in Information and Communications Technology (ICT), cloud based applications provide a novel approach to access applications which are not installed on the local computers. The integration of cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) indicated a bright future of the Internet. In this paper, a new architecture of cloud computing—Model as a Service (MaaS) is proposed. The feasibility of the proposed architecture is proved by implementing a groundwater model on cloud as a case study. The groundwater model is established using MODFLOW for the middle reach of the Heihe River Basin (HRB). The model is calibrated using in situ observation to ensure capability of simulating the groundwater process with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.70 m and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.64. The parameter uncertainties of the groundwater model are analyzed by sequential data assimilation algorithms (PF, Particle Filter; EnKF, Ensemble Kalman Filter) in a synthetic case. The results show that the parameter uncertainties are effectively reduced by incorporating observed information recursively. A comparison between PF and EnKF indicate that the results from PF are slightly better than those from EnKF. The integration shows a bright future for simulating the groundwater system in real-time. This study provides a flexible and effective approach for analyzing the uncertainties and time variant properties of the parameters and the proposed architecture of cloud computing provides a novel approach for the researchers and decision-makers to construct numerical models and follow-up researches.                </td>

            The Internet of Things (IoT) is characterized by a broad range of resources connected to the Internet, requesting and providing services simultaneously. Given this scenario, suitably selecting the resources that best meet users’ demands has been a relevant and current research challenge. Based on the non-functional parameters of Quality of Service (QoS), IoT plays an important role in the ranking of these resources according to the offered services. This paper presents a proposal to classify and select the most appropriate resource for the client’s request, applying fuzzy logic to address uncertainties in the definition of ideal weights for QoS attributes, and aggregating machine learning to the pre-classification of EXEHDA middleware resources, in order to reduce the computational cost generated by MCDA algorithms. As the main contribution, the pre-classification of new resources of the EXEHDA-RR is presented. The experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed model.

            As a new intelligent manufacturing model, the Internet of Manufacturing Things (IOMT) based on the Internet of Things technology has a large amount of random, fuzzy, and uncertain information, which makes the optimization of manufacturing services face challenges. On the basis of fully considering the uncertain factors in the process of manufacturing service, a quality of service (QoS) optimization method based on mixed information axioms is proposed to solve the optimization problem of manufacturing service in the IOMT environment. The mixed uncertainty model is expounded with random variables to express the range of system and fuzzy variables to describe the design range. In order to select the best resource or sort, the fuzzy mathematics and the axiomatic theory of axiomatic design theory are combined to evaluate the coexistence of ambiguity and randomness of the QoS. Finally, the process of treatment and optimization in practical application by taking the example of a hydraulic pump product seeking service through the civil aircraft IOMT service platform is described. This example is given out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with the traditional information axiom method, and this method extends the application scope of traditional information axioms.

            This paper presents a stochastic programming approach, using a risk measure defined by conditional value-at-risk, for trading solar energy in a market environment under uncertainty. Uncertainties on electricity price and solar irradiation are considered through a set of scenarios computed by simulation and scenario-reduction. The short-term operation problem of a concentrating solar power plant is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, which allows modelling the discrete status of the plant. To improve the operational productivity of the plant during the non-insulation periods, energy storage systems are considered. The goal is to obtain the optimal operation planning that maximizes the total expected profits while evaluating trading risks. For risk evaluation, the conditional value-at-risk is used to maximize the expected profits of the least profitable scenarios. A case study is used to illustrate the usefulness and the proficiency of the proposed approach.

            Pervasive information consumers in open, loosely-coupled systems, such as in Internet of Things and crowd-sensing environment, will rely more and more often on streaming information from sensory sources with whom they have only ephemeral, transient relationships. In such settings, information uncertainties arise as the trustworthiness of the sources and their information become questionable. It is thus necessary to quantify the quality of inferences made with such information to aid more informed and effective decision making and action taking. One of the aspects of trust assessment systems is to provide for such quality metrics, however, these systems have been traditionally applied in static situations. In this paper, we introduce TAF, a trust assessment framework for streaming information that leverages the rich toolkit of subjective logic operators to estimate the quality of said inferences under information uncertainty. We present the system architecture, describe its components and provide some preliminary quality results for the framework.        </td>

							The use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and devices is on a sharp rise with the help of infrastructures like 5G cellular networks. However, with this swift expansion come major challenges such as management of the vast data collected by these IoT devices. In the paper, we propose a method which takes advantage of fuzzy similarity to significantly simplify the big data analysis and management for human operators and machines. A use case in the area of smart buildings was utilized to illustrate its potential application. A comparison is made between the ideal situation and the data collected from an office room. The considered environmental factors in this research are temperature, humidity, and workplace lighting and then the collected data was utilized to make triangular fuzzy numbers and after that, we compare them with an efficient fuzzy similarity measure. In addition to data summarization and abstraction, this method also protects the main information from inaccuracy. The advantage of the fuzzy controlling system is its aptitude to deal with nonlinearities and uncertainties.

							With the emergence of the Internet of Things and smart devices, smart homes are becoming more and more popular. The main goal of this study is to implement an event driven system in a smart home and to extract meaningful information from the raw data collected by the deployed sensors using Complex Event Processing (CEP). These high-level events can then be used by multiple smart home applications in particular situation identification. However, in real life scenarios, low-level events are generally uncertain. In fact, an event may be outdated, inaccurate, imprecise or in contradiction with another one. This can lead to misinterpretation from CEP and the associated applications. To overcome these weaknesses, in this paper, we propose a Fuzzy Semantic Complex Event Processing (FSCEP) model which can represent and reason with events by including domain knowledge and integrating fuzzy logic. It handles multiple dimensions of uncertainty, namely freshness, accuracy, precision and contradiction. FSCEP has been implemented and compared with a well known CEP. The results show how some ambiguities are solved.

						When creating the Internet of Things and Smart Machines, the RULES ENGINE pattern is developed. The tasks that Rules Engine solves in real time are characterized by large amounts of data from various sensors. To account for uncertainty, a new model of Smart Rules Engine is proposed with a two-step inference engine, including an engine of abstraction from data. A model based on quantitative, definitive and generalization type of abstraction is considered. It is shown that the proposed model solves the problem of the bridge between natural language, as a carrier of the concept's meaning, and data from sensors, as carriers of the perception. A model for presenting a prototype is given in which incomplete knowledge, expert's uncertainty in the definition of the concept and aging of data are taken into account. The prototype and data model representation and the abstraction engine are built based on fuzzy L-R numbers and arithmetic operations on them. The preliminary step of abstraction from the data, besides taking into account the uncertainty of a different nature, significantly reduces the dimension of the fuzzy inference space. A comparison of the two-step fuzzy inference engine with the traditional inference engine Fuzzy Logic System Type-1 is given using the example of a wheeled robot making the decision to safely cross an unregulated crossroad.

						In recent years, expectations for large-scale wireless sensor networks have been rapidly increased due to miniaturization, cost reduction, reduction in power consumption of wireless sensor devices, and the emergence of wireless sensor network applications such as IoT (Internet Of Things). However, in addition to the uncertainty inherent in wireless sensor networks, due to the uncertainty caused by the expansion of wireless sensor networks, it is not easy to realize a highly efficient and reliable large-scale wireless sensor network. The uncertainty of wireless sensor networks is classified into three types: the uncertainty of nodes such as sensor nodes and sink nodes, the uncertainty of wireless communication links among nodes, and the uncertainty of traffic transferred over the wireless sensor network. In this paper, as a wireless communication standard, we focus on IEEE 802.15.4, which is designed for short-range wireless networks called PANs (Personal Area Networks), and analyze large-scale wireless sensor networks using fluid approximation. Specifically, IEEE 802.15.4 large-scale wireless sensor networks are analyzed by extending the modeling approach for generic CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) wireless networks. Moreover, our analysis makes it possible to probabilistically model temporal fluctuation of wireless communication ranges of nodes as network uncertainty. As a result, our analysis clarifies the effect of link uncertainty on the average message delivery delay in wireless sensor networks.

Mathematical models for security risk assessment in IoT are proposed and investigated. In relation to the concept of multi-agent network control, the Mamdani fuzzy inference procedures for risk assessment and management are developed. Procedures for fuzzy clustering, classification and ranking of security threats are outlined. The experimental results show high stability of the developed security risks management algorithms to uncertainties of input variables.

               	   	Internet of Vehicles (IoV, shortly) is a typical system of Internet of Things. Spatio-Temporal event stream is one of basic features of IoV. These event streams often are uncertain due to the limit of the monitoring device and the high speed of vehicles. Developing an event processing language to process these spatio-temporal event streams with uncertainty is a challenge issue. The goal of this paper is to develop a Probabilistic Event Processing Language, called as Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Event Processing language (PSTEP, shortly), dealing with this challenge issue. In PSTEP, we use the Possible World Model to express uncertain spatio-temporal events of IoV and assign a spatio-temporal event with a probability which is the threshold value for processing the existence of an event. We establish its syntax and operational semantics. Finally, a case study is given to show the effectiveness of the PSTEP language.

               	   The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to connect billions of devices, that will interact with their physical environment through sensors or actuators. The measurements created from these sensors have varying levels of precision, leading to measurements that follow a distribution, whose variance presents an additional challenge for the employed security schemes. In this work we assume a smart attacker would attempt to mask his attack in the inherent uncertainty of the measurements, and attempt to manipulate the distribution of measurements as covertly as possible to affect the final meaningful value that the system would result in. We employ Game Theory to examine the best strategies to slowly corrupt the integrity of an IoT network, similar to ETSI's Low Throughput Networks (LTN). We examine the extent of the changes that can be made to the distribution without assuming a priori knowledge of it by the attacker, for different scenarios and compromisation patterns. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to examine the limits of the compromise that could be applied by a smart attacker on an IoT/LTN-type network without triggering outlier-alarms, and can be applied in the design of better targeted defensive measures.

                                The enhancement in the number of sensors deployed to collect every single bit of information to develop intelligent applications is potentially growing in today's Internet of Things paradigm. The acquired data from sensors is to be inferred into meaningful information for decision making to address real world situations. Context information modeling and reasoning is one of the investigative research concern in the design and development of smart health care applications. As the accessed information is inherently imperfect, we propose a computational intelligence technique to analyze uncertainty associated with sensor data. In this paper, we propose Context Information, Observation and Belief (C-IOB) model from the perspective of in-hospital environment and the analysis is based on Bayesian network to deal with imprecise information. The proposed model provides a relevant service based on our research findings.

                                The popular use of wearable devices and mobile phones makes the effective capture of life-logging physical activity (PA) data in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment possible. The effective collection of measures of PA in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers and patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, life-logging PA information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this study, the authors project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as daily activity in physical space and present an ellipse-fitting model-based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging PA measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method remarkably improves the validity of PA measures in a healthcare platform.

                                The sharing of data and resources in Future Internet applications (Machine-to-Machine (M2M), Internet of Things (IoT), Web of People (Web2.0), Web of Data (Web3.0)) and the massive distribution of data sources introduces heterogeneity in the Quality of Information (QoI) produced. It is thus necessary to be able to evaluate the QoI at any time and to take it into account for further processing and analysis. In this paper, we present an extension of a semantic context broker which enables to handle the dual problems of trust amongst the data sources and uncertainty in the context data. This extension is based on incorporating one ontology for modeling uncertainty and one ontology for modeling trust, to an IoT ontology that the initial semantic context broker was already based upon. The resulting system has been implemented and tested successfully on real data.

               	   			Trust and uncertainty are important aspects of many distributed systems. Managing them together forms a complex problem, even more in the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), where having multiple sources of information is very common. The devices of the IoT face two-fold problems of managing trust on sources and the presence of uncertainty in the information. We propose a solution to these problems. Our solution approach involves modeling applications of the IoT as intelligent agents that comprise a trust management module, an inference engine and an enhanced Assumption-based Truth Maintenance System (ATMS) to manage trust of the information sources and uncertainty of the inferred information. We validate our approach using empirical data obtained from simulations.

               	   			The utility of wearables is currently limited to lab experiments and controlled environments mainly because computational algorithms embedded in wearables fail to produce accurate measurements in uncontrolled, dynamically changing, and potentially harsh environments. With the exponentially growing adoption of these systems in human-centered Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, development of resource-efficient solutions to enhance the accuracy of this systems remains a considerable research challenge. In this paper, we introduce an energy-efficient framework for uncertainty management of networked wearables. The core components of our framework are anomaly screening units for detecting anomalies that require handling, thus resulting in one order of magnitude less energy consumption compared to the conventional frameworks. Furthermore, our screening approach achieves 98.3% accuracy in detecting anomalies based on real data collected with wearable motion sensors.

                                Process algebra is one of the best suitable formal methods to model smart systems based on IoT, especially Smart Factory. However, because of some uncertainty, it is necessary to model predictability of the systems, based on the uncertainty. There have been several process algebras with probability, such as, PAROMA, PACSR, etc. However they are not well suitable for the smart systems, since they are based only on discrete model or exponential model. Consequently, only simple or targeted probability can be specified and analyzed. In order to handle such limitations, the paper presents a new formal method, called dTP-Calculus, extended from the existing dT-Calculus with discrete, normal, exponential, and uniform probability models. It provides all the possible probability features for Smart Factory with complex uncertainty. The specification of the modeling will be simulated statistically for Smart Factory, and further the simulation results will be analyzed for probabilistic properties of the systems. For implementation, a tool set for the calculus has been developed in the SAVE tool suite on the ADOxx Meta-Modeling Platform, including Specifier, Analyzer and Verifier. A Smart Factory example from Audi Cell Production System has been selected as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

                                Timeliness, accuracy and effectiveness of manufacturing information in manufacturing and business process management have become important factors of constraint to business growth. Single RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology with uncertainty will cause great difficulties for application systems. This paper mainly focuses on the process of manufacturing information, real-time information perception and processing problems. It achieves real-time manufacturing information acquisition and processing by combining RFID and sensor technology, which uses Complex Event Processing (CEP) mechanism to realize sensor and RFID data fusion. First of all, the event processing framework which is from the perspective of the integration of sensors and RFID is given. Then, real-time acquisition and intelligent information processing models were introduced, including primitive event handling and complex event processing method. Finally, the practicality of our method was verified through applying it to a mold manufacturing enterprise management field.

                                A new context-aware data- and patient-centric paradigm for ubiquitous healthcare is central to deliver personalized healthcare solutions to the elderly and the physically challenged. However, this new paradigm requires real-time in-the-field processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models and analysis of the processed information (derived physiological parameters) under context (e.g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, an innovative resource provisioning framework that harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., smart phones, laptops, tablets, DVRs, medical terminals) to form a mobile computing grid is presented. The framework is imparted with self-optimization and self-healing capabilities for efficiency and robustness under uncertainty, respectively. The proposed mobile grid management framework serves as a key enabling technology for Internet-of-Things- (IoT-) based next-generation ubiquitous healthcare solutions.

                                One of the main purposes of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems is to provide information on the observed physical system and to notify when a certain observed complex event occurs in the system. The biggest challenge of the IoT systems is that the systems collect a massive amount of uncertain data from diverse IoT devices, where the devices are connected through the internet. In addition to that, some events are inferred from other events and uncertainty is propagated from parent events to the inferred events, which additionally contributes to overall system uncertainty. The observed complex events are a complex relationship of primitive events that are produced by IoT devices and collected in IoT system. There were a couple of attempts to quantify the system uncertainty by estimating the likelihood of the occurrence of events of interest while taking into account the uncertain data and uncertain parameters of the model of the physical system with rule-based complex event processing and/or Bayesian network. These methods were implemented as stand-alone software solutions that are unable to scale under heavy loads of incoming events. This paper proposes a micro-service based notification methodology that uses complex event recognition to handle the IoT system uncertainty.

                               Internet of Things devices, such as video-based detectors or road side units are being deployed in emerging applications like sustainable and intelligent transportation systems. Oftentimes, stringent operation and energy cost constraints are exerted on this type of applications, necessitating a hybrid supply of renewable and grid energy. The key issue of a cost-constrained hybrid of renewable and grid power is its uncertainty in energy availability. The characteristic of approximate computation that accepts an approximate result when energy is limited and executes more computations yielding better results if more energy is available, can be exploited to intelligently handle the uncertainty. In this paper, we first propose an energy-adaptive task allocation scheme that optimally assigns real-time approximate-computation tasks to individual processors and subsequently enables a matching of the cost-constrained hybrid supply of energy with the energy demand of the resultant task schedule. We then present a quality of service (QoS)-driven task scheduling scheme that determines the optional execution cycles of tasks on individual processors for optimization of system QoS. A dynamic task scheduling scheme is also designed to adapt at runtime the task execution to the varying amount of the available energy. Simulation results show that our schemes can reduce system energy consumption by up to 29% and improve system QoS by up to 108% as compared to benchmarking algorithms.

                               Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is widely used to track and trace objects in supply chain management. However, massive uncertain data produced by RFID readers are not suitable for directly use in RFID applications. Following our thorough analysis of key features of RFID objects, this paper proposes a new framework for effectively and efficiently processing uncertain RFID data, and supporting a variety of queries for tracking and tracing RFID objects. In particular, we propose an adaptive cleaning method by adjusting size of smoothing window according to various rates of uncertain data, employing different strategies to process uncertain readings, and distinguishing different types of uncertain data according to their appearing positions. We propose a comprehensive data model, which is suitable for a wide range of application scenarios. In addition, a path coding scheme is proposed to significantly compress massive data by aggregating the path sequences, the positions and the time intervals. Experimental evaluations show that our approach is effective and efficient in terms of the compression and traceability queries.

                               Device-to-device communication is widely used for mobile devices and Internet of Things. Authentication and key agreement are critical to build a secure channel between two devices. However, existing approaches often rely on a pre-built fingerprint database and suffer from low key generation rate. We present GeneWave, a fast device authentication and key agreement protocol for commodity mobile devices. GeneWave first achieves bidirectional initial authentication based on the physical response interval between two devices. To keep the accuracy of interval estimation, we eliminate time uncertainty on commodity devices through fast signal detection and redundancy time cancellation. Then, we derive the initial acoustic channel response for device authentication. We design a novel coding scheme for efficient key agreement while ensuring security. Therefore, two devices can authenticate each other and securely agree on a symmetric key. GeneWave requires neither special hardware nor pre-built fingerprint database, and thus it is easyto-use on commercial mobile devices. We implement GeneWave on mobile devices (i.e., Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P) and evaluate its performance through extensive experiments. Experimental results show that GeneWave efficiently accomplish secure key agreement on commodity smartphones with a key generation rate 10× faster than the state-of-the-art approach.

                              Since Internet of Things (IoT) applications are deployed within open physical environments, their executions suffer from a wide spectrum of uncertain factors (e.g., network delay, sensor inputs). Although ThingML is a promising IoT modeling and specification language which enables the fast development of resource-constrained IoT applications, it lacks the capability to model such uncertainties and quantify their effects. Consequently, within uncertain environments the quality and performance of IoT applications generated from ThingML designs cannot be guaranteed. To explore the overall runtime performance variations caused by environmental uncertainties, this paper proposes a quantitative uncertainty evaluation framework for ThingML-based IoT designs. By adopting network of priced timed automata as the model of computation and statistical model checking as the evaluation engine, our approach can model uncertainties caused by external environments as well as support various kinds of performance queries on the extended ThingML designs. Experimental results of two comprehensive case studies demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

                              The Internet of Things is the natural continuity of the Ambient Intelligence where smart and ambient environments are built mainly by integrating a large number of interconnected smart objects (sensors, actuators, Smartphone, appliances, etc.) with heterogeneous capabilities abstracted as software services. These services can be composed on the fly and provided, all the time and everywhere, to assist users in their daily activities. A key issue in user-centered services composition is to intelligently and effectively discover and select the most relevant services that best match the users' requirements and closely meet the specified quality-of-service level. Monitoring seamlessly the provided services and enhancing their quality, is still a challenging issue due mainly to the dynamicity and uncertainty characterizing ambient environments. In this paper, we propose a new service-oriented, user-centered and event-aware Framework capable of performing services monitoring to handle automatically events that may occur in ambient environments. This monitoring is based on a dynamic services discovery and selection process to enhance self-adaptation to unpredicted changes, and ensure services continuity with best quality. The overall proposed Framework has been implemented and validated through a scenario dedicated to daily activity recognition in an Ambient-Assisted Living environment. In addition, the obtained performances from extensive tests show clearly the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed approach in the case of a large-scale environment.

                             Recently, the popular use of wearable devices and mobile apps makes the effectively capture of lifelogging physical activity data in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment possible. The effective collection of measures of physical activity in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers to patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging physical activity information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing life-logging physical activity measurement devices, and identify regular and irregular uncertainties of these activity measures in an IoT environment. We then project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as Daily Activity in Physical Space (DAPS). Finally, we present an ellipse fitting model based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging physical activity measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method effectively improves the validity of physical activity measures in a healthcare platform.

                             Internet of Things (IoT) technology offers opportunities to monitor lifelogging data by a variety of assets, like wearable sensors, mobile apps, etc. But due to heterogeneity of connected devices and diverse human life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging personal data contains huge uncertainty and are hardly used for healthcare studies. Effective validation of lifelogging personal data for longitudinal health assessment is demanded. In this paper, lifelogging physical activity (LPA) is taken as a target to explore how to improve the validity of lifelogging data in an IoT enabled healthcare system. A rule-based adaptive LPA validation (LPAV) model, LPAV-IoT, is proposed for eliminating irregular uncertainties (IUs) and estimating data reliability in IoT healthcare environments. A methodology specifying four layers and three modules in LPAV-IoT is presented for analyzing key factors impacting validity of LPA. A series of validation rules are designed with uncertainty threshold parameters and reliability indicators and evaluated through experimental investigations. Following LPAV-IoT, a case study on a personalized healthcare platform myhealthavatar connecting three state-of-the-art wearable devices and mobile apps are carried out. The results reflect that the rules provided by LPAV-IoT enable efficiently filtering at least 75% of IU and adaptively indicating the reliability of LPA data on certain condition of IoT environments.

                             Due to the ability to handle uncertain nonlinear hybrid systems, barrier certificate based method has been widely used in safety verification problem. In this paper, an efficient framework, combining sum of squares programming with interval analysis, is proposed to generate barrier certificates for uncertain nonlinear hybrid systems. It utilizes the feature of bounded uncertainties to get a deterministic hybrid system, whose barrier certificates can be efficiently computed using sum of squares programming. The computed barrier certificates are then chosen as candidate barrier certificates for the original uncertain hybrid system, and need to be checked the satisfaction of the associated barrier certificate conditions, via an interval analysis based method. As an application, our approach is used to verify safety properties of non-polynomial hybrid systems. Some experimental results are given to show the efficiency of our approach.

                             With the economic globalization and the intensification of market competition, competition between enterprises has developed into competition between supply chains. The influence and change of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology on the spatial structure and economic relationship of supply chain are all-round and profound, and then affect the allocation of resources and supply chain operation, which will lead to many new management problems. These problems will become a new field of enterprise supply chain management innovation. Based on the fuzzy theory, this paper uses six-point fuzzy numbers to represent the uncertainty in the supply chain and uses the possibility theory to establish the evaluation criteria for the overall performance of the supply chain. In order to satisfy the constraints of the final product order fulfillment rate and minimize the overall inventory cost of the supply chain, the model integrates and optimizes the manufacturing resource allocation strategy of the supply chain in the IoT. Finally, the effectiveness of the model is verified by simulation, which provides theoretical support for the decision-making of the supply chain enterprises in the IoT environment

               	   	Having a shared and accurate sense of time is critical to distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols, it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed systems with unprecedented accuracy. However, applications have not benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services that help manage time, and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces through which timing information flows to the application. Due to the importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications, running on commodity platforms and operating systems, it is imperative to rethink how time is handled across the system stack. We advocate the adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time (QoT) that captures metrics such as resolution, accuracy, and stability. Building on this notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time is a controllable operating system primitive with observable uncertainty, and where time synchronization balances applications' timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth. Our architecture features an expressive application programming interface that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline - a virtual temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide its components with a shared sense of time, with a desired accuracy and resolution. The timeline abstraction enables developers to easily write applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space. Leveraging open source hardware and software components, we have implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform. Results from its evaluation are also presented.

So, for a particular time period, it is very tough to find the appropriate data for its certainty. In this paper, all received sensor data are to be assumed as fuzzy numbers, and such assumption could be beneficial to improve the functionality of data availability and accessibility in service-oriented architecture (SOA) system. Whenever any service is requested for updated sensor data, it must be handled through well-defined architecture, and this is governed by enterprise service bus (ESB). This ESB extends the features for SOA as well as strengthen the service middleware architecture. Sensor data received through this ESB would need corrections and cleanliness which could be done through fuzzy theory and help in reducing the uncertainty in data.

                                Crowded public venues are significantly under risks and uncertainties caused by fire and overcrowding hazards. For this purpose, Situational Awareness (SiA) -that is a mechanism to know what is going on around- can facilitate the automatic (or human involved) critical decision making and executing processes. Considering the dynamic and uncertain essence of crowd and hazard behavior in an emergency, executing the optimum evacuation plan is highly complex and needs strong models. In this paper, taking in input a model of the Cyber-Physical Space under SiA monitoring, we define an architectural-map-based Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to describe and predict crowd and hazard behavior. Then, in order to minimize the total evacuation time, the authors present a quickest flow model for consecutive time intervals. Overall, the paper shows the importance of hazard quiddity, and crowd behavior on the evacuation efficiency in emergency situations. The approach is demonstrated through a small (but concrete) running example.

                                Detecting the anomalies timely in the condition monitoring data, which are highly relevant to the potential system faults, has become a research focus in many domains. Among the various detection methods available, the prediction-based algorithms are popular without using prior knowledge and expert labels. Additionally, these methods can take the time-ordered specialty into account which is highly significant for time-series-based anomaly detection. However, the detected feedback is binary, especially, due to the influence of inaccurate confidence interval (CI), the false alarm phenomena occur frequently based on predicted models. Thus this paper proposes an Uncertainty Fusion method to realize anomaly detection. Firstly, in order to estimate the data uncertainty, the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is applied to perform the prediction with uncertainty presentation. Then, based on the GPR model, the improved k-fold cross-validation is combined to represent the model uncertainty. Moreover, the quantitative error index is designed to provide more detecting information for decision-making. Eventually, the effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by different simulated and open-source data sets, as well as the real application in mobile traffic data detecting. The quantitative results on simulated data experiments show the proposed method can largely eliminate the false alarms without sacrificing much detection rate compared with the basic GPR model. Especially, the experiments on periodic data sets with high Signal Noise Ratio have the better performance. And the mobile traffic data detecting proves the Uncertainty Fusion method can expand the basic GPR model to meet the real industrial requirements.

                                The Internet of Things (IoT) connects millions of devices of different cyber-physical systems (CPSs) providing the CPSs additional (implicit) redundancy during runtime. However, the increasing level of dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity adds to the system's vulnerability, and challenges its ability to react to faults. Self-healing is an increasingly popular approach for ensuring resilience, that is, a proper monitoring and recovery, in CPSs. This work encodes and searches an adaptive knowledge base in Prolog/ProbLog that models relations among system variables given that certain implicit redundancy exists in the system. We exploit the redundancy represented in our knowledge base to generate adaptive runtime monitors which compare related signals by considering uncertainties in space and time. This enables the comparison of uncertain, asynchronous, multi-rate and delayed measurements. The monitor is used to trigger the recovery process of a self-healing mechanism. We demonstrate our approach by deploying it in a real-world CPS prototype of a rover whose sensors are susceptible to failure.

               	   			Industry 4.0 is the fourth and current working paradigm leaning on data exchange, data analysis and Internet of things for complete automation and optimization of manufacturing technologies. This 4.0 paradigm enables the possibility for optimal autonomous decision making and full autonomous operation of the facility. Since all manufacturing processes are inherently in-deterministic, optimal decision making will only work when provided with realistic uncertainty models. The authors have observed that the typical used prediction models are not accurate as they do not represent the in-deterministic nature of the processes in a realistic manner. The objective of this paper is to use the IoT- based logged data to design more relevant uncertainty models to optimize the industry 4.0 framework. For this purpose, p-box models are used to represent production variation as function of unknown in-deterministic parameters. Furthermore, by using regression learning on the database, we show that the uncertainty can be decreased. It is shown that classic stochastic models are not able to capture the full in-deterministic nature of the uncertainties. It makes therefore sense that autonomous decision making based on such stochastic models are unreliable and sub-optimal. Future research possibilities are discussed, based on the proposed uncertainty models, together with possible notions that will help in the development of reliable optimal decision making and more accurate adaptable Industry 4.0 framework.

                           Design decisions made during early development stages of self-adaptive systems tend to have a
                           significant impact upon system properties at run time (e.g., safety, QoS). However,
                           understanding the implications of these decisions a priori is difficult due to the different
                           types and degrees of uncertainty that affect such systems (e.g., simplifying assumptions,
                           human-in-the-loop). To provide some assurances about self-adaptive system designs, evidence
                           can be gathered from activities such as simulations and prototyping, but these demand a
                           significant effort and do not provide a systematic way of dealing with uncertainty. In this
                           chapter, we describe an approach based on model checking of stochastic multiplayer games
                           (SMGs) that enables developers to approximate the behavioral envelope of a self-adaptive
                           system by analyzing best- and worst-case scenarios of alternative designs for self-adaptation
                           mechanisms. Compared to other sources of evidence, such as simulations or prototypes, our
                           approach is purely declarative and hence has the potential of providing developers with a
                           preliminary understanding of adaptation behavior with less effort, and without the need to
                           have any specific adaptation algorithms or infrastructure in place. We illustrate our
                           approach by showing how it can be used to mitigate different types of uncertainty in contexts
                           such as self-protecting systems, proactive latency-aware adaptation, and human-in-the-loop
                           adaptation.

                           satisfaction of the same requirements under uncertain environments is even more challenging.
                           Tools and techniques to inform engineers about poorly-understood design spaces in the
                           presence of uncertainty are needed, so that engineers can explore the design space,
                           especially when tradeoffs are crucial. To tackle this problem, we describe an approach that
                           combines synthesis of spaces of system design alternatives from formal specifications of
                           architectural styles with probabilistic formal verification. The main contribution of this
                           paper is a formal framework for specification-driven synthesis and analysis of design spaces
                           that provides formal guarantees about the correctness of system behaviors and satisfies
                           quantitative properties (e.g., defined over system qualities) subject to uncertainty, which
                           is treated as a first-class entity. We illustrate our approach in two case studies: a
                           service-based adaptive system and a mobile robotics architecture. Our results show how the
                           framework can provide useful insights into how average case probabilistic guarantees can
                           differ from worst case guarantees, emphasizing the relevance of combining quantitative formal
                           verification methods with structural synthesis, in contrast with techniques based on
                           simulation and dynamic analysis that can only provide estimates about average case
                           probabilistic properties.

                           Self-Adaptive systems are expected to adapt to unanticipated run-time events using imperfect

                     This keynote talk and paper intend to motivate research projects that investigate novel ways to model, analyze, and mitigate uncertainty arising in three different aspects of the cyber-physical systems. First, uncertainty about the physical environment can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes catastrophic, results as the system tries to adapt to unanticipated or poorly-understood environmental conditions. Second, uncertainty in the cyber environment can have lead to unexpected and adverse effects, including not only performance impacts (load, traffic, etc.) but also potential threats or overt attacks. Finally, uncertainty can exist with the components themselves and how they interact upon reconfiguration, including unexpected and unwanted feature interactions. Each of these sources of uncertainty can potentially be identified at different stages, respectively run time, design time, and requirements, but their mitigation might be done at the same or a different stage. Based on the related literature and our preliminary investigations, we argue that the following three overarching techniques are essential and warrant further research to provide enabling technologies to address uncertainty at all three stages: model-based development, assurance, and dynamic adaptation. Furthermore, we posit that in order to go beyond incremental improvements to current software engineering techniques, we need to leverage, extend, and integrate techniques from other disciplines.                </td>

					[Context/ Motivation] A smart device is a software-intensive system that operates autonomously and interacts to some degree with other systems over wireless connections. Such systems are often faced with uncertainty in the environment. Runtime representations of requirements have recently gained more interested to deal with this challenge and the term requirements at runtime has been established. Runtime representations of requirements support reasoning about the requirements at runtime and adapting the configuration of a system according to changes in the environment. [Questions/Problems] The research question is how the results of runtime monitoring of requirements and the system’s decisions about changes in the configuration are communicated back to the requirements engineer to better understand the environment. There is a gap between the written requirements document and the dynamic requirements model inside the system. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that a requirements document are mostly informal while the dynamic requirements model is formal. [Principal ideas/results] This paper introduces an approach to bridge the gap between development time and runtime representations of requirements in order to keep them consistent and to facilitate better understanding. We propose to weave the feedback from the runtime system into requirements documents using a domain-specific language that largely retain the informal nature of requirements. An annotated requirements document helps get a better understanding of the system’s actual behavior in a given environment. The approach is implemented using mbeddr, a novel set of domain-specific languages for developing embedded systems, and illustrated using a running example.

                                Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are expected to continuously monitor the physical components to autonomously calculate appropriate runtime reactions to deal with the uncertain environmental conditions. Self-adaptation, as a promising concept to fulfill a set of provable rules, majorly needs runtime quantitative verification (RQV). Taking a few probabilistic variables into account to represent the uncertainties, the system configuration will be extremely large. Thus, efficient approaches are needed to reduce the model state-space, preferably with certain bounds on the approximation error. In this paper, we propose an approximation framework to efficiently approximate the entire model of a self-adaptive system. We split up the large model into strongly-connected components (SCCs), apply the approximation algorithm separately on each SCC, and integrate the result of each part using a centralized algorithm. Due to a number of changes in probabilistic variables, it is not possible to use static models. Addressing this issue, we have deployed parametric Markov decision process. In order to apply approximation on the model, the notion of ε-approximate probabilistic bisimulation is utilized that introduces the approximation level ε. We show that our approximation framework offers a certain error bound on each level of approximation. Then, we denote that the approximation framework is appropriate to be applied in decision-making process of self-adaptive systems where the models are relatively large. The results reveal that we can achieve up to 50% size reduction in the approximate model while maintaining the accuracy about 95%. In addition, we discuss about the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy of our approximation framework.

                                A challenging issue in the architectural design of a System-of-Systems (SoS) is how to cope with the uncertainty raised by the limited knowledge of the operational environment where the SoS will actually be deployed as well as the constituent systems which will concretely participate in the SoS at run-time. It is especially the case of SoSs being architected on the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Indeed, due to the open and dynamic nature of the IoT, on the one hand, at design-time, most often the SoS architects do not know which will be the concrete IoT systems that will become constituents of an SoS, these being predominantly identified at run-time; on the other hand, the correct architecture depends not only on the constituent IoT systems but also, largely, on the operational environment where the SoS will be positioned on the IoT. The consequent research question is thereby how to design and describe the SoS architecture in a way that is flexible enough to cope with these different uncertainties. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the notion of uncertainty in SoS and presents how SosADL, a formal SoS Architecture Description Language (ADL), enables to cope with uncertainty in the architecture modeling of SoSs. It presents the concepts and constructs that makes possible to describe SoS architectures which will operate in unpredictable environments on the IoT based on the SosADL support for dealing with partial knowledge, grounded on concurrent constraints.

                                We increasingly live in cyber-physical spaces: spaces that are both physical and digital, and where the two aspects are intertwined. Cyber-physical spaces may exhibit a range of behaviors, from smart control of heating, ventilation, and light to visionary multi-functional living spaces that can be spatially re-organized in a dynamic way. In contrast to traditional physical environments, cyber-physical spaces often exhibit dynamic behaviors: they can change over time and react to changes occurring in space. Current design of spaces, however, does not normally accommodate the cyber aspects of modern spatial environments and does not capture their dynamic behavior. Spatial design, although done with CAD tools and following certain international processes and standards, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), largely produces syntactic descriptions of spaces which lack dynamic semantics. As a consequence, designs cannot be automatically (and formally) analyzed with respect to various requirements emerging from dynamic cyber-physical spaces; safety, security or reliability requirements being typical examples of this. This paper will show an avenue for research which can be characterized as rethinking the design of spatial environments, i.e., dynamic cyber-physical spaces, from a software engineering perspective. We outline our approach where formally analyzable models may be automatically extracted from BIM depending on the analysis required, and then checked against formally specified requirements, both regarding static and dynamic properties of the design, prior to the construction phase (at design time). To realize automated operational management, these models can also be used during operation to continuously check satisfaction of the requirements when changes occur, and possibly enforce their satisfaction through self-adaptive strategies (at run-time).

                             Runtime uncertainty such as unpredictable resource unavailability, changing environmental conditions and user needs, as well as system intrusions or faults represents one of the main current challenges of self-adaptive systems. Moreover, today's systems are increasingly more complex, distributed, decentralized, etc. and therefore have to reason about and cope with more and more unpredictable events. Approaches to deal with such changing requirements in complex today's systems are still missing. This work presents SACRE (Smart Adaptation through Contextual REquirements), our approach leveraging an adaptation feedback loop to detect self-adaptive systems’ contextual requirements affected by uncertainty and to integrate machine learning techniques to determine the best operationalization of context based on sensed data at runtime. SACRE is a step forward of our former approach ACon which focus had been on adapting the context in contextual requirements, as well as their basic implementation. SACRE primarily focuses on architectural decisions, addressing self-adaptive systems’ engineering challenges. Furthering the work on ACon, in this paper, we perform an evaluation of the entire approach in different uncertainty scenarios in real-time in the extremely demanding domain of smart vehicles. The real-time evaluation is conducted in a simulated environment in which the smart vehicle is implemented through software components. The evaluation results provide empirical evidence about the applicability of SACRE in real and complex software system domains.

                            Adaptive systems are expected to adapt to unanticipated run-time events using imperfect information about themselves, their environment, and goals. This entails handling the effects of uncertainties in decision-making, which are not always considered as a first-class concern. This paper contributes a formal analysis technique that explicitly considers uncertainty in sensing when reasoning about the best way to adapt, together with uncertainty reduction mechanisms to improve system utility. We illustrate our approach on a Denial of Service (DoS) attack scenario and present results that demonstrate the benefits of uncertainty-aware decision-making in comparison to using an uncertainty-ignorant approach, both in the presence and absence of uncertainty reduction mechanisms.

               	   		Medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) combine independent devices at runtime in order to render new patient monitoring/control functionalities, such as physiological closed loops for controlling drug infusion and optimization of alarms. MCPS and their relevant system contexts are highly variable, which detrimentally affects the application of established safety assurance methodologies. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on dynamic risk assessment and control for MCPS. During runtime, information regarding the safety properties of the constituent systems, relevant information about the patient’s characteristics, as well as other relevant context information is utilized to dynamically and continuously optimize the system performance while guaranteeing an acceptable level of safety. We evaluated our approach by means of a patient-controlled analgesia proof-of-concept simulation and sensitivity analysis.

                               A critical issue in the Web of Things (WoT) is the need to process and analyze the interactions of Web-interconnected real-world objects. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a powerful technology for analyzing streams of information about real-time distributed events, coming from different sources, and for extracting conclusions from them. However, in many situations these events are not free from uncertainty, due to either unreliable data sources and networks, measurement uncertainty, or to the inability to determine whether an event has actually happened or not. This short research paper discusses how CEP systems can incorporate different kinds of uncertainty, both in the events and in the rules. A case study is used to validate the proposal, and we discuss the benefits and limitations of this CEP extension.

                                A challenging issue in the architectural design of a System-of-Systems (SoS) is how to cope with the uncertainty raised by the limited knowledge of the operational environment where the SoS will actually be deployed as well as the constituent systems which will concretely participate in the SoS at run-time. It is especially the case of SoSs being architected on the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Indeed, due to the open and dynamic nature of the IoT, on the one hand, at design-time, most often the SoS architects do not know which will be the concrete IoT systems that will become constituents of an SoS, these being predominantly identified at run-time; on the other hand, the correct architecture depends not only on the constituent IoT systems but also, largely, on the operational environment where the SoS will be positioned on the IoT. The consequent research question is thereby how to design and describe the SoS architecture in a way that is flexible enough to cope with these different uncertainties. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the notion of uncertainty in SoS and presents how SosADL, a formal SoS Architecture Description Language (ADL), enables to cope with uncertainty in the architecture modeling of SoSs. It presents the concepts and constructs that makes possible to describe SoS architectures which will operate in unpredictable environments on the IoT based on the SosADL support for dealing with partial knowledge, grounded on concurrent constraints.

               	   			Self-adaptation provides a principled way to deal with software systems’ uncertainty during operation. Examples of such uncertainties are disturbances in the environment, variations in sensor readings, and changes in user requirements. As more systems with strict goals require self-adaptation, the need for formal guarantees in self-adaptive systems is becoming a high-priority concern. Designing self-adaptive software using principles from control theory has been identified as one of the approaches to provide guarantees. In general, self-adaptation covers a wide range of approaches to maintain system requirements under uncertainty, ranging from dynamic adaptation of system parameters to runtime architectural reconfiguration. Existing control-theoretic approaches have mainly focused on handling requirements in the form of setpoint values or as quantities to be optimized. Furthermore, existing research primarily focuses on handling uncertainty in the execution environment. This article presents SimCA*, which provides two contributions to the state-of-the-art in control-theoretic adaptation: (i) it supports requirements that keep a value above and below a required threshold, in addition to setpoint and optimization requirements; and (ii) it deals with uncertainty in system parameters, component interactions, system requirements, in addition to uncertainty in the environment. SimCA* provides guarantees for the three types of requirements of the system that is subject to different types of uncertainties. We evaluate SimCA* for two systems with strict requirements from different domains: an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle system used for oceanic surveillance and an Internet of Things application for monitoring a geographical area. The test results confirm that SimCA* can satisfy the three types of requirements in the presence of different types of uncertainty.

                                Crowded public venues are significantly under risks and uncertainties caused by fire and overcrowding hazards. For this purpose, Situational Awareness (SiA) -that is a mechanism to know what is going on around- can facilitate the automatic (or human involved) critical decision making and executing processes. Considering the dynamic and uncertain essence of crowd and hazard behavior in an emergency, executing the optimum evacuation plan is highly complex and needs strong models. In this paper, taking in input a model of the Cyber-Physical Space under SiA monitoring, we define an architectural-map-based Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to describe and predict crowd and hazard behavior. Then, in order to minimize the total evacuation time, the authors present a quickest flow model for consecutive time intervals. Overall, the paper shows the importance of hazard quiddity, and crowd behavior on the evacuation efficiency in emergency situations. The approach is demonstrated through a small (but concrete) running example.

                                Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are expected to continuously monitor the physical components to autonomously calculate appropriate runtime reactions to deal with the uncertain environmental conditions. Self-adaptation, as a promising concept to fulfill a set of provable rules, majorly needs runtime quantitative verification (RQV). Taking a few probabilistic variables into account to represent the uncertainties, the system configuration will be extremely large. Thus, efficient approaches are needed to reduce the model state-space, preferably with certain bounds on the approximation error. In this paper, we propose an approximation framework to efficiently approximate the entire model of a self-adaptive system. We split up the large model into strongly-connected components (SCCs), apply the approximation algorithm separately on each SCC, and integrate the result of each part using a centralized algorithm. Due to a number of changes in probabilistic variables, it is not possible to use static models. Addressing this issue, we have deployed parametric Markov decision process. In order to apply approximation on the model, the notion of ε-approximate probabilistic bisimulation is utilized that introduces the approximation level ε. We show that our approximation framework offers a certain error bound on each level of approximation. Then, we denote that the approximation framework is appropriate to be applied in decision-making process of self-adaptive systems where the models are relatively large. The results reveal that we can achieve up to 50% size reduction in the approximate model while maintaining the accuracy about 95%. In addition, we discuss about the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy of our approximation framework.

               	   			Due to the uncertainty of what actual adaptations will be performed at run time, verifying adaptive systems at design time may lead to limited results or may even be infeasible. Run-time verification techniques have been proposed to cope with this uncertainty. Recently, there has been an increasing interest to use model checking (an important verification technique) at run time in order to verify the expected properties of adaptive systems. Given a system specification and expected system properties, a model checker determines whether or not the specification satisfies its properties in the presence of self-adaptation. One key concern is the generally high resource needs of model checking, which may prohibit its use on resource- and power-constrained devices, such as smart-phones or Internet-of-Things devices. To address this challenge, we introduce a cloud-based framework that delivers model checking as a service (MCaaS). MCaaS offloads computationally intensive model checking tasks to the cloud, thereby offering verification capabilities on demand. Adaptive systems running on any kind of connected device may take the advantages of model checking at run time by invoking the MCaaS service. To dynamically allocate the required cloud resources (CPU and memory), we employ machine learning to estimate the resource usage of an actual model checking task at run time. As proof of concept, we implement and validate the approach for the case of probabilistic model checking, which facilitates verifying typical properties such as reliability.

                            Self-adaptation is an established approach to deal with uncertainties that are difficult to predict before a system is deployed. A self-adaptative system employs a feedback loop that tracks changes and adapts the system accordingly to ensure its quality goals. However, making effective adaptation decisions at runtime is challenging. In this chapter we tackle two problems of effective decision making in self-adaptive systems. First, current research typically focusses on the benefits adaptaton can bring but ignores the cost of adaptation, which may invalidate the expected benefits. To tackle this problem, we introduce CB@R (Cost-Benefit analysis @ Runtime), a novel model-based approach for runtime decision-making in self-adaptive systems that handles both the benefits and costs of adaptation as first-class citizens in decision making. Second, we look into the adaptation space of self-adaptive systems, i.e. the set of adaption options to select from. For systems with a large number of adaptation options, analyzing the entire adaptation space is often not feasible given the time and resources constraints at hand. To tackle this problem, we present a machine learning approach that integrates learning with the feedback loop to select a subset of the adaption options that are valid in the current situation. We evaluate CB@R and the learning approach for a real world deployed Internet of Things (IoT) application.

This paper presents the first results of our work on how to deal with environment uncertainty in goal-based requirements engineering. This work is motivated by the fact that current goal-based approaches do not natively allow for unanticipated adaptations. To do so, we explore the introduction of RELAX concepts into SysMLKaos. RELAX is a Requirements Engineering language for Dynamically Adaptive Systems that includes explicit constructs to handle the inherent uncertainty in these systems. On the other hand, SysMLKaos is a Goal Based Requirements Engineering approach that takes into account Non-Functional Requirements at the same level of abstraction as Functional Requirements and models the impact of Non-Functional Requirements on Functional Requirements. We use an extract of a Landing Gear System case study to illustrate the proposed approach.

For some classes of systems - especially deterministic systems, like Mealy machines, a variety of learning algorithm implementations is readily available. In this paper, we apply this technique to a measurement device from the automotive industry in order to systematically test its behaviour. However, our system under learning shows sparse non-deterministic behaviour, preventing the direct application of the available learning tools.
											We propose an implementation of the active automata learning framework which masks this non-determinism. We repeat a previous model-based testing experiment with faulty devices and show that we can detect all injected faults. Most importantly, our technique was also able to find unknown bugs.

               	   	 Multi-objective uncertainty-wise test case minimization focuses on selecting a minimum number of test cases to execute out of all available ones while maximizing effectiveness (e.g., coverage), minimizing cost (e.g., time to execute test cases), and at the same time optimizing uncertainty-related objectives. In our previous unpublished work, we developed four uncertainty-wise test case minimization strategies relying on Uncertainty Theory and multi-objective search (NSGA-II with default settings), which were evaluated with one real Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with inherent uncertainty. However, a fundamental question to answer is whether these default settings of NSGA-II are good enough to provide optimized solutions. In this direction, we report one of the preliminary empirical evaluations, where we performed an experiment with three different mutation operators and three crossover operators, i.e., in total nine combinations with NSGA-II for the four uncertainty-wise test case minimization strategies using a real CPS case study. Results show that the Blend Alpha crossover operator together with the polynomial mutation operator permits NSGA-II achieving the best performance for solving our uncertainty-wise test minimization problems.

               	   	As compared with classical software/system testing, uncertainty-wise testing explicitly addresses known uncertainty about the behavior of a System Under Test (SUT), its operating environment, and interactions between the SUT and its operational environment, across all testing phases, including test design, test generation, test optimization, and test execution, with the aim to mainly achieve the following two goals. First, uncertainty-wise testing aims to ensure that the SUT deals with known uncertainty adequately. Second, uncertainty-wise testing should be also capable of learning new (previously unknown) uncertainties such that the SUT's implementation can be improved to guard against newly learned uncertainties during its operation. The necessity to integrate uncertainty in testing is becoming imperative because of the emergence of new types of intelligent and communicating software-based systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Intrinsically, such systems are exposed to uncertainty because of their interactions with highly indeterminate physical environments. In this chapter, we provide our understanding and experience of uncertainty-wise testing from the aspects of uncertainty-wise model-based testing, uncertainty-wise modeling and evolution of test ready models, and uncertainty-wise multiobjective test optimization, in the context of testing CPSs under uncertainty. Furthermore, we present our vision about this new testing paradigm and its plausible future research directions.

Model-based robust design is difficult because of the complexity of the hybrid dynamic models including continuous vehicle dynamics, the discrete models of computations and communications, and the size of the problem. We will overview recent advances in methodology and tools to model, analyze, and design robust autonomous aerospace systems operating in uncertain environment, with stress on efficient uncertainty quantification and robust design using the case studies of the mission including model-based target tracking and search, and trajectory planning in uncertain urban environment. To show that the methodology is generally applicable to uncertain dynamical systems, we will also show examples of application of the new methods to efficient uncertainty quantification of energy usage in buildings, and stability assessment of interconnected power networks.

               	   			The computational data received from sensors are varying according to situation depending on data accuracy. So, for a particular time period, it is very tough to find the appropriate data for its certainty. In this paper, all received sensor data are to be assumed as fuzzy numbers, and such assumption could be beneficial to improve the functionality of data availability and accessibility in service-oriented architecture (SOA) system. Whenever any service is requested for updated sensor data, it must be handled through well-defined architecture, and this is governed by enterprise service bus (ESB). This ESB extends the features for SOA as well as strengthen the service middleware architecture. Sensor data received through this ESB would need corrections and cleanliness which could be done through fuzzy theory and help in reducing the uncertainty in data.

                           M2M is one of the sustained hot research area that envisaged to promote the growth of IoTs

                           household. Current researches are more focused on the sheer technological (e.g., protocol

                           observation and others technical gaps makes it difficult to design a practical Smart Home

                           together with an efficient inference scheme which incorporates reasoning with uncertainty.

                           The emergence of the Internet of Things paves the way for enhancing the monitoring
                           capabilities of enterprises by means of extensive use of physical and virtual sensors
                           generating a multitude of data. The generated real-time data streams provide the basis for
                           anticipating future undesired events and thus enable enterprises to decide and act ahead of
                           time, i.e. in a proactive manner. Proactive information systems can benefit from the use of
                           context-awareness in order to provide more reliable recommendations. In this paper we propose
                           a probabilistic model for context-aware proactive event-driven decision making that deals
                           with the uncertainty that is inherent in the contextual elements' values. We validated our
                           approach in an oil and gas industry scenario and we conducted a comparative analysis.

                           Design decisions made during early development stages of self-adaptive systems tend to have a
                           significant impact upon system properties at run time (e.g., safety, QoS). However,
                           understanding the implications of these decisions a priori is difficult due to the different
                           types and degrees of uncertainty that affect such systems (e.g., simplifying assumptions,
                           human-in-the-loop). To provide some assurances about self-adaptive system designs, evidence
                           can be gathered from activities such as simulations and prototyping, but these demand a
                           significant effort and do not provide a systematic way of dealing with uncertainty. In this
                           chapter, we describe an approach based on model checking of stochastic multiplayer games
                           (SMGs) that enables developers to approximate the behavioral envelope of a self-adaptive
                           system by analyzing best- and worst-case scenarios of alternative designs for self-adaptation
                           mechanisms. Compared to other sources of evidence, such as simulations or prototypes, our
                           approach is purely declarative and hence has the potential of providing developers with a
                           preliminary understanding of adaptation behavior with less effort, and without the need to
                           have any specific adaptation algorithms or infrastructure in place. We illustrate our
                           approach by showing how it can be used to mitigate different types of uncertainty in contexts
                           such as self-protecting systems, proactive latency-aware adaptation, and human-in-the-loop
                           adaptation.

                           Designing software in a way that guarantees run-time behavior while achieving an acceptable
                           balance among multiple quality attributes is an open problem. Providing guarantees about the
                           satisfaction of the same requirements under uncertain environments is even more challenging.
                           Tools and techniques to inform engineers about poorly-understood design spaces in the
                           presence of uncertainty are needed, so that engineers can explore the design space,
                           especially when tradeoffs are crucial. To tackle this problem, we describe an approach that
                           combines synthesis of spaces of system design alternatives from formal specifications of
                           architectural styles with probabilistic formal verification. The main contribution of this
                           paper is a formal framework for specification-driven synthesis and analysis of design spaces
                           that provides formal guarantees about the correctness of system behaviors and satisfies
                           quantitative properties (e.g., defined over system qualities) subject to uncertainty, which
                           is treated as a first-class entity. We illustrate our approach in two case studies: a
                           service-based adaptive system and a mobile robotics architecture. Our results show how the
                           framework can provide useful insights into how average case probabilistic guarantees can
                           differ from worst case guarantees, emphasizing the relevance of combining quantitative formal
                           verification methods with structural synthesis, in contrast with techniques based on
                           simulation and dynamic analysis that can only provide estimates about average case
                           probabilistic properties.

                           The problem of building statistical models of cyber-physical systems using operational data
                           is addressed in this paper, using thecase study of aircraft engines. These models serve as a
                           complementto physics-based models, which may not accurately reflect the operational
                           performance of systems. The accurate modeling of fuelflow rate is an essential aspect of
                           analyzing aircraft engine performance. In this paper, operational data from Flight Data
                           Recordersare used to model the fuel flow rate. The independent variablesare restricted to
                           those which are obtainable from trajectory data.Treating the engine as a statistical system,
                           an algorithm based onGaussian Process Regression (GPR) is developed to estimate thefuel flow
                           rate during the airborne phases of flight. The algorithmpropagates the uncertainty in the
                           estimates in order to determineprediction intervals. The proposed GPR models are evaluated
                           fortheir predictive performance on an independent set of flights. Theresulting estimates are
                           also compared with those given by the Baseof Aircraft Data (BADA) model, which is widely used
                           in aircraftperformance studies. The GPR models are shown to perform statistically
                           significantly better than the BADA model. The GPR modelsalso provide interval estimates for
                           the fuel flow rate which reflectthe variability seen in the data, presenting a promising
                           approachfor data-driven modeling of cyber-physical systems.

                              This keynote talk and paper intend to motivate research projects that investigate novel ways to model, analyze, and mitigate uncertainty arising in three different aspects of the cyber-physical systems. First, uncertainty about the physical environment can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes catastrophic, results as the system tries to adapt to unanticipated or poorly-understood environmental conditions. Second, uncertainty in the cyber environment can have lead to unexpected and adverse effects, including not only performance impacts (load, traffic, etc.) but also potential threats or overt attacks. Finally, uncertainty can exist with the components themselves and how they interact upon reconfiguration, including unexpected and unwanted feature interactions. Each of these sources of uncertainty can potentially be identified at different stages, respectively run time, design time, and requirements, but their mitigation might be done at the same or a different stage. Based on the related literature and our preliminary investigations, we argue that the following three overarching techniques are essential and warrant further research to provide enabling technologies to address uncertainty at all three stages: model-based development, assurance, and dynamic adaptation. Furthermore, we posit that in order to go beyond incremental improvements to current software engineering techniques, we need to leverage, extend, and integrate techniques from other disciplines.                </td>

                The ever-growing complexity of software systems coupled with their stringent availability requirements are challenging the manual management of software after its deployment. This has motivated the development of self-adaptive software systems. Self-adaptation endows a software system with the ability to satisfy certain objectives by automatically modifying its behavior at runtime. While many promising approaches for the construction of self-adaptive software systems have been developed, the majority of them ignore the uncertainty underlying the adaptation. This has been one of the key inhibitors to widespread adoption of self-adaption techniques in risk-averse real-world applications. Uncertainty in this setting is a vaguely understood term. In this paper, we characterize the sources of uncertainty in self-adaptive software system, and demonstrate its impact on the system’s ability to satisfy its objectives. We then provide an alternative notion of optimality that explicitly incorporates the uncertainty underlying the knowledge (models) used for decision making. We discuss the state-of-the-art for dealing with uncertainty in this setting, and conclude with a set of challenges, which provide a road map for future research.

                Most automated systems operate in uncertain or adversarial conditions, and have to be capable of reliably reacting to changes in the environment. The focus of this paper is on automatically synthesizing reactive controllers for cyber-physical systems subject to signal temporal logic (STL) specifications. We build on recent work that encodes STL specifications as mixed integer linear constraints on the variables of a discrete-time model of the system and environment dynamics. To obtain a reactive controller, we present solutions to the worst-case model predictive control (MPC) problem using a suite of mixed integer linear programming techniques. We demonstrate the comparative effectiveness of several existing worst-case MPC techniques, when applied to the problem of control subject to temporal logic specifications; our empirical results emphasize the need to develop specialized solutions for this domain.

                Trajectory generation is at the heart of an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Given a navigation context, the UAV has to conceive a trajectory that fulfills its mission goal while avoiding collisions with obstacles and surrounding traffic. This intended trajectory is an idealization of the various actual physical trajectories that the UAV may perform during flight. The validation of actual physical trajectories with respect to their intended counterparts is challenging due to the interaction over time of several uncontrolled factors such as the environmental conditions, measurement errors and the cyber-physical components of the UAV. For this reason, the most common validation technique for trajectory generators is flight simulation, which is not exhaustive and thus cannot prove the actual absence of collisions.
    
                This paper presents a preliminary formal framework to reason about the safety of UAV trajectories with respect to static-obstacle collision avoidance taking account of the uncertainties derived from uncontrolled factors. The proposed framework was formally verified in a mechanical theorem prover. Its application as an oracle for black-box testing validation of trajectory generators is also proposed. Such testing strategy would allow the safety evaluation of trajectories while removing the need for simulation procedures, thus reducing the cost of the validation process.

               	   	Self-adaptive software-intensive cyber-physical systems (sasiCPS) encounter a high level of run-time uncertainty. State-of-the-art architecture-based self-adaptation approaches assume designing against a fixed set of situations that warrant self-adaptation; as a result, failures may appear when sasiCPS operate in environment conditions they are not specifically designed for. In response, we propose to increase the homeostasis of sasiCPS, i.e., the capacity to maintain an operational state despite run-time uncertainty, by introducing run-time changes to the architecture-based self-adaptation strategies according to environment stimuli. In addition to articulating the main idea of architectural homeostasis, we describe three mechanisms that reify the idea: (i) collaborative sensing, (ii) faulty component isolation from adaptation, and (iii) enhancing mode switching. Moreover, our experimental evaluation of the three mechanisms confirms that allowing a complex system to change its self-adaptation strategies helps the system recover from runtime errors and abnormalities and keep it in an operational state.

               	   	Self-adaptive software-intensive cyber-physical systems (sasiCPS) encounter a high level of run-time uncertainty. State-of-the-art architecture-based self-adaptation approaches assume designing against a fixed set of situations that warrant self-adaptation. As a result, failures may appear when sasiCPS operate in environment conditions they are not specifically designed for. In response, we propose to increase the homeostasis of sasiCPS, i.e., the capacity to maintain an operational state despite run-time uncertainty, by introducing run-time changes to the architecture-based self-adaptation strategies according to environment stimuli. In addition to articulating the main idea of architectural homeostasis, we introduce four mechanisms that reify the idea: (i) collaborative sensing, (ii) faulty component isolation from adaptation, (iii) enhancing mode switching, and (iv) adjusting guards in mode switching. Moreover, our experimental evaluation of the four mechanisms in two different case studies confirms that allowing a complex system to change its self-adaptation strategies helps the system recover from run-time errors and abnormalities and keep it in an operational state.

                        Context: Software Fuzzy Self-Adaptation (SFSA) is a fuzzy control-based software self-adaptation paradigm proposed to deal with the fuzzy uncertainty existing in self-adaptive software. However, as many software engineers lack fuzzy control knowledge, it is difficult for them to design and model this kind of fuzzy self-adaptive software (F-SAS). Therefore, efficient and effective modeling technologies and tools are needed for the SFSA framework.
                        Objective: This paper aims to identify modeling requirements of F-SAS and to provide a modeling framework to specify, design and model F-SAS systems. Such a framework can simplify modeling process of F-SAS and improve the accessibility of software engineers to the SFSA paradigm.
                        Method: This study proposes a modeling framework called Fuzzy self-Adaptation ModEling (FAME). By extending UML, FAME creates three types of modeling views. An analysis view called Fuzzy Case Diagram is created to specify the fuzzy self-adaptation goal and the realization processes of this goal. A structure view called Fuzzy Class Diagram is created to describe the fuzzy concepts and structural characteristics of F-SAS. A behavior view called Fuzzy Sequence Diagram is created to depict the dynamic behaviors of the F-SAS systems. The framework is implemented as a plug-in of Enterprise Architect.
                        Results: We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach by carrying out a subject-based empirical evaluation. The results show that FAME framework can improve modeling quality of F-SAS systems by 44.38% and shorten modeling time of F-SAS systems by 38.41% in comparison with traditional UML. Thus, FAME can considerably ease the modeling process of F-SAS systems.
                        Conclusion: FAME framework incorporates the SFSA concepts into standard UML. Therefore, it provides a direct support to model SFSA characteristics and improves the accessibility of software engineers to the SFSA paradigm. Furthermore, it behaves a good example and provides good references for modeling domain-specific software systems.

                       This paper presents a sound and complete fault detection approach for cyber–physical systems represented by hidden-mode switched affine models with time varying parametric uncertainty. The fault detection approach builds upon techniques from model invalidation. In particular, a set-membership approach is taken where the noisy input–output data is compared to the set of behaviors of a nominal model. As we show, this set-membership check can be reduced to the feasibility of a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which can be solved efficiently by leveraging the state-of-the-art MILP solvers. In the second part of the paper, given a system model and a fault model, the concept of -detectability is introduced. If a pair of system and fault models satisfies -detectability property for a finite , this allows the model invalidation algorithm to be implemented in a receding horizon manner, without compromising detection guarantees. In addition, the concept of weak-detectability is introduced which extends the proposed approach to a more expressive class of fault models that capture language constraints on the mode sequences. Finally, the efficiency of the approach is illustrated with numerical examples motivated by smart building radiant systems.

                            In the current era of big data, huge volumes of a wide variety of valuable data of different veracity (e.g., uncertain data) can be easily collected and generated from a broad range of data sources (e.g., social networking sites) at a high velocity in various real-life applications. Many traditional data management and analytic approaches may not be suitable for handling the big data due to their well-known 5V’s characteristics. In this paper, we present a cognitive-based system for social network analysis. Our system supports information discovery of interesting social patterns from big uncertain social networks—which are represented in the form of key-value pairs—capturing the perceived likelihood of the linkages among the social entities in the network.

                        A self-adaptive cyber-physical system (SACPS) can adjust its behavior and configurations at runtime in response to varying requirements obtained from the system and the environment. With the increasing use of the SACPS in different application domains, such variations are becoming more common. Users today expect the SACPS to guarantee its functional and timing behavior even in adverse environmental situations. However, uncertainties in the SACPS environment impose challenges on assuring the runtime behavior during system design.
                       Software product line engineering (SPLE) is considered as a useful technique for handling varying requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for assuring the runtime behavior of the SACPS by applying an SPLE technique such as feature modeling. By representing the feature-based model at design time, we characterize the possible adaptation requirements to reusable configurations. The proposed approach aims to model two dynamic variability dimensions: 1) environment variability that describes the conditions under which the SACPS must adapt, and 2) structural variability, that defines the resulting architectural configurations. To validate our approach, the experimental analysis is performed using two case studies: 1) a traffic monitoring SACPS and 2) an automotive SACPS. We demonstrate that the proposed feature-based modeling approach can be used to achieve adaptivity which allows the SACPS to assure functional (defining execution of the correct set of adaptive tasks) and non-functional (defining execution of SACPS in the expected mode) correctness at runtime. The experimental results show that the feature-based SACPS demonstrates significant improvement in terms of self-configuration time, self-adaptation time and scalability with less probability of failure in different environmental situations.

							This paper develops a sampled-data (SD) controller for uncertain multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, possibly with non-minimum phase zeros, using the L1 adaptive control architecture. The proposed controller compensates for disturbances and uncertainties within the bandwidth of a low-pass filter. Sufficient conditions for robust stability are obtained for the closed-loop system with SD controller, where the input/output signals are held constant over a sampling period. It is shown that the hybrid closed-loop system can recover the performance of a continuous-time reference system as the sampling time of the SD controller tends to zero. Simulation examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings.

							Cyber-physical systems are often hybrid consisting of both discrete and continuous subsystems. The continuous dynamics in cyber-physical systems could be noisy and the environment in which these stochastic hybrid systems operate can also be uncertain. We focus on multimodal hybrid systems in which the switching from one mode to another is determined by a schedule and the optimal finite horizon control problem is to discover the switching schedule as well as the control inputs to be applied in each mode such that some cost metric is minimized over the given horizon. We consider discrete-time control in this paper. We present a two step approach to solve this problem with respect to convex cost objectives and probabilistic safety properties. Our approach uses a combination of sample average approximation and convex programming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on case studies from temperature-control in buildings and motion planning.

					[Context/ Motivation] A smart device is a software-intensive system that operates autonomously and interacts to some degree with other systems over wireless connections. Such systems are often faced with uncertainty in the environment. Runtime representations of requirements have recently gained more interested to deal with this challenge and the term requirements at runtime has been established. Runtime representations of requirements support reasoning about the requirements at runtime and adapting the configuration of a system according to changes in the environment. [Questions/Problems] The research question is how the results of runtime monitoring of requirements and the system’s decisions about changes in the configuration are communicated back to the requirements engineer to better understand the environment. There is a gap between the written requirements document and the dynamic requirements model inside the system. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that a requirements document are mostly informal while the dynamic requirements model is formal. [Principal ideas/results] This paper introduces an approach to bridge the gap between development time and runtime representations of requirements in order to keep them consistent and to facilitate better understanding. We propose to weave the feedback from the runtime system into requirements documents using a domain-specific language that largely retain the informal nature of requirements. An annotated requirements document helps get a better understanding of the system’s actual behavior in a given environment. The approach is implemented using mbeddr, a novel set of domain-specific languages for developing embedded systems, and illustrated using a running example.

						When creating the Internet of Things and Smart Machines, the RULES ENGINE pattern is developed. The tasks that Rules Engine solves in real time are characterized by large amounts of data from various sensors. To account for uncertainty, a new model of Smart Rules Engine is proposed with a two-step inference engine, including an engine of abstraction from data. A model based on quantitative, definitive and generalization type of abstraction is considered. It is shown that the proposed model solves the problem of the bridge between natural language, as a carrier of the concept's meaning, and data from sensors, as carriers of the perception. A model for presenting a prototype is given in which incomplete knowledge, expert's uncertainty in the definition of the concept and aging of data are taken into account. The prototype and data model representation and the abstraction engine are built based on fuzzy L-R numbers and arithmetic operations on them. The preliminary step of abstraction from the data, besides taking into account the uncertainty of a different nature, significantly reduces the dimension of the fuzzy inference space. A comparison of the two-step fuzzy inference engine with the traditional inference engine Fuzzy Logic System Type-1 is given using the example of a wheeled robot making the decision to safely cross an unregulated crossroad.

               	   Self-healing cyber-physical systems (SH-CPSs) detect and recover from faults by themselves at runtime. Testing such systems is challenging due to the complex implementation of self-healing behaviors and their interaction with the physical environment, both of which are uncertain. To this end, we propose an executable model-based approach to test self-healing behaviors under environmental uncertainties. The approach consists of a Modeling Framework of SH-CPSs (MoSH) and an accompanying Test Model Executor (TM-Executor). MoSH provides a set of modeling constructs and a methodology to specify executable test models, which capture expected system behaviors and environmental uncertainties. TM-Executor executes the test models together with the systems under test, to dynamically test their self-healing behaviors under uncertainties. We demonstrated the successful application of MoSH to specify 11 self-healing behaviors and 17 uncertainties for three SH-CPSs. The time spent by TM-Executor to perform testing activities was in the order of milliseconds, though the time spent was strongly correlated with the complexity of test models.

               	   Self-healing is becoming an essential behavior of smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), which enables them to recover from faults by themselves. Such behaviors make decisions autonomously at runtime and they often operate in an uncertain physical environment making testing even more challenging. To this end, we propose Fragility-Oriented Testing (FOT), which relies on model execution and reinforcement learning to cost-effectively test self-healing behaviors of CPSs in the presence of environmental uncertainty. We evaluated FOT’s performance by comparing it with a Coverage-Oriented Testing (COT) algorithm. Evaluation results show that FOT significantly outperformed COT for testing nine self-healing behaviors implemented in three case studies. On average, FOT managed to find 80% more faults than COT and for cases when both FOT and COT found the same faults, FOT took on average 50% less time than COT.

                                This paper develops a model-based framework for the quantification and propagation of multiple uncertainty sources affecting the performance of a smart system. A smart system, in general, performs sensing, control and actuation for proper functioning of a physical subsystem (also referred to as a plant). With strong feedback coupling between several subsystems, the uncertainty in the quantities of interest (QoI) amplifies over time. The coupling in a generic smart system occurs at two levels: (1) coupling between individual subsystems (plant, cyber, actuation, sensors), and (2) coupling between nodes in a distributed computational subsystem. In this paper, a coupled smart system is decoupled and considered as a feed-forward system over time and modeled using a two-level Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), one at each level of coupling (between subsystems and between nodes). A DBN can aggregate uncertainty from multiple sources within a time step and across time steps. The DBN associated with a smart system can be learned using available system models, physics models and data. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for the design of a smart indoor heating system (identification of sensors and a wireless network) within cost constraints that enables room-by-room temperature control. We observe that sensor uncertainty has a higher impact on the performance of the heating system compared to the uncertainty in the wireless network.

                                A challenging issue in the architectural design of a System-of-Systems (SoS) is how to cope with the uncertainty raised by the limited knowledge of the operational environment where the SoS will actually be deployed as well as the constituent systems which will concretely participate in the SoS at run-time. It is especially the case of SoSs being architected on the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Indeed, due to the open and dynamic nature of the IoT, on the one hand, at design-time, most often the SoS architects do not know which will be the concrete IoT systems that will become constituents of an SoS, these being predominantly identified at run-time; on the other hand, the correct architecture depends not only on the constituent IoT systems but also, largely, on the operational environment where the SoS will be positioned on the IoT. The consequent research question is thereby how to design and describe the SoS architecture in a way that is flexible enough to cope with these different uncertainties. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the notion of uncertainty in SoS and presents how SosADL, a formal SoS Architecture Description Language (ADL), enables to cope with uncertainty in the architecture modeling of SoSs. It presents the concepts and constructs that makes possible to describe SoS architectures which will operate in unpredictable environments on the IoT based on the SosADL support for dealing with partial knowledge, grounded on concurrent constraints.

                                The Internet of Things (IoT) connects millions of devices of different cyber-physical systems (CPSs) providing the CPSs additional (implicit) redundancy during runtime. However, the increasing level of dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity adds to the system's vulnerability, and challenges its ability to react to faults. Self-healing is an increasingly popular approach for ensuring resilience, that is, a proper monitoring and recovery, in CPSs. This work encodes and searches an adaptive knowledge base in Prolog/ProbLog that models relations among system variables given that certain implicit redundancy exists in the system. We exploit the redundancy represented in our knowledge base to generate adaptive runtime monitors which compare related signals by considering uncertainties in space and time. This enables the comparison of uncertain, asynchronous, multi-rate and delayed measurements. The monitor is used to trigger the recovery process of a self-healing mechanism. We demonstrate our approach by deploying it in a real-world CPS prototype of a rover whose sensors are susceptible to failure.

               	   			Designing secure cyber-physical systems (CPS) is a particularly difficult task since security vulnerabilities stem not only from traditional cybersecurity concerns, but also physical ones. Many of the standard methods for CPS design make strong and unverified assumptions about the trustworthiness of physical devices, such as sensors. When these assumptions are violated, subtle inter-domain vulnerabilities are introduced into the system model. In this paper we use formal specification of analysis contracts to expose security assumptions and guarantees of analyses from reliability, control, and sensor security domains. We show that this specification allows us to determine where these assumptions are violated, opening the door to malicious attacks. We demonstrate how this approach can help discover and prevent vulnerabilities using a self-driving car example.

               	   			A cyber-physical system (CPS) comprises several connected, embedded systems and is additionally equipped with sensors and actuators. Thus, CPSs can communicate with their cyber environment and measure and interact with their physical environment. Due to the complexity of their operational environment, assumptions the manufacturer have made may not hold in operation. During an unforeseen environmental situation, a CPS may expose behavior that negatively impactsits reliability. This may arise due to insufficiently considered environmental conditions during the design of a CPS, or – even worse – it is impossible to anticipate such conditions. In the U-Test project, we are developing a configurable search-based testing framework that exploits information from functional testing and from declarative descriptions of uncertainties. Itaims at revealing unintended behavior in the presence of uncertainties. This framework enables testing for different scenarios of uncertainty and thus, allows to achieve a certain coverage of those, and to find unknown uncertainty scenarios.

               	   			Self-adaptation provides a principled way to deal with software systems’ uncertainty during operation. Examples of such uncertainties are disturbances in the environment, variations in sensor readings, and changes in user requirements. As more systems with strict goals require self-adaptation, the need for formal guarantees in self-adaptive systems is becoming a high-priority concern. Designing self-adaptive software using principles from control theory has been identified as one of the approaches to provide guarantees. In general, self-adaptation covers a wide range of approaches to maintain system requirements under uncertainty, ranging from dynamic adaptation of system parameters to runtime architectural reconfiguration. Existing control-theoretic approaches have mainly focused on handling requirements in the form of setpoint values or as quantities to be optimized. Furthermore, existing research primarily focuses on handling uncertainty in the execution environment. This article presents SimCA*, which provides two contributions to the state-of-the-art in control-theoretic adaptation: (i) it supports requirements that keep a value above and below a required threshold, in addition to setpoint and optimization requirements; and (ii) it deals with uncertainty in system parameters, component interactions, system requirements, in addition to uncertainty in the environment. SimCA* provides guarantees for the three types of requirements of the system that is subject to different types of uncertainties. We evaluate SimCA* for two systems with strict requirements from different domains: an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle system used for oceanic surveillance and an Internet of Things application for monitoring a geographical area. The test results confirm that SimCA* can satisfy the three types of requirements in the presence of different types of uncertainty.

                                Acceptance testing validates that a system meets its requirements and determines whether it can be sufficiently trusted and put into operation. For cyber physical systems (CPS), acceptance testing is a hardware-in-the-loop process conducted in a (near-)operational environment. Acceptance testing of a CPS often necessitates that the test cases be prioritized, as there are usually too many scenarios to consider given time constraints. CPS acceptance testing is further complicated by the uncertainty in the environment and the impact of testing on hardware. We propose an automated test case prioritization approach for CPS acceptance testing, accounting for time budget constraints, uncertainty, and hardware damage risks. Our approach is based on multi-objective search, combined with a test case minimization algorithm that eliminates redundant operations from an ordered sequence of test cases. We evaluate our approach on a representative case study from the satellite domain. The results indicate that, compared to test cases that are prioritized manually by satellite engineers, our automated approach more than doubles the number of test cases that fit into a given time frame, while reducing to less than one third the number of operations that entail the risk of damage to key hardware components.

                                We increasingly live in cyber-physical spaces: spaces that are both physical and digital, and where the two aspects are intertwined. Cyber-physical spaces may exhibit a range of behaviors, from smart control of heating, ventilation, and light to visionary multi-functional living spaces that can be spatially re-organized in a dynamic way. In contrast to traditional physical environments, cyber-physical spaces often exhibit dynamic behaviors: they can change over time and react to changes occurring in space. Current design of spaces, however, does not normally accommodate the cyber aspects of modern spatial environments and does not capture their dynamic behavior. Spatial design, although done with CAD tools and following certain international processes and standards, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), largely produces syntactic descriptions of spaces which lack dynamic semantics. As a consequence, designs cannot be automatically (and formally) analyzed with respect to various requirements emerging from dynamic cyber-physical spaces; safety, security or reliability requirements being typical examples of this. This paper will show an avenue for research which can be characterized as rethinking the design of spatial environments, i.e., dynamic cyber-physical spaces, from a software engineering perspective. We outline our approach where formally analyzable models may be automatically extracted from BIM depending on the analysis required, and then checked against formally specified requirements, both regarding static and dynamic properties of the design, prior to the construction phase (at design time). To realize automated operational management, these models can also be used during operation to continuously check satisfaction of the requirements when changes occur, and possibly enforce their satisfaction through self-adaptive strategies (at run-time).

                              Since Internet of Things (IoT) applications are deployed within open physical environments, their executions suffer from a wide spectrum of uncertain factors (e.g., network delay, sensor inputs). Although ThingML is a promising IoT modeling and specification language which enables the fast development of resource-constrained IoT applications, it lacks the capability to model such uncertainties and quantify their effects. Consequently, within uncertain environments the quality and performance of IoT applications generated from ThingML designs cannot be guaranteed. To explore the overall runtime performance variations caused by environmental uncertainties, this paper proposes a quantitative uncertainty evaluation framework for ThingML-based IoT designs. By adopting network of priced timed automata as the model of computation and statistical model checking as the evaluation engine, our approach can model uncertainties caused by external environments as well as support various kinds of performance queries on the extended ThingML designs. Experimental results of two comprehensive case studies demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

                              The Internet of Things is the natural continuity of the Ambient Intelligence where smart and ambient environments are built mainly by integrating a large number of interconnected smart objects (sensors, actuators, Smartphone, appliances, etc.) with heterogeneous capabilities abstracted as software services. These services can be composed on the fly and provided, all the time and everywhere, to assist users in their daily activities. A key issue in user-centered services composition is to intelligently and effectively discover and select the most relevant services that best match the users' requirements and closely meet the specified quality-of-service level. Monitoring seamlessly the provided services and enhancing their quality, is still a challenging issue due mainly to the dynamicity and uncertainty characterizing ambient environments. In this paper, we propose a new service-oriented, user-centered and event-aware Framework capable of performing services monitoring to handle automatically events that may occur in ambient environments. This monitoring is based on a dynamic services discovery and selection process to enhance self-adaptation to unpredicted changes, and ensure services continuity with best quality. The overall proposed Framework has been implemented and validated through a scenario dedicated to daily activity recognition in an Ambient-Assisted Living environment. In addition, the obtained performances from extensive tests show clearly the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed approach in the case of a large-scale environment.

                             Runtime uncertainty such as unpredictable resource unavailability, changing environmental conditions and user needs, as well as system intrusions or faults represents one of the main current challenges of self-adaptive systems. Moreover, today's systems are increasingly more complex, distributed, decentralized, etc. and therefore have to reason about and cope with more and more unpredictable events. Approaches to deal with such changing requirements in complex today's systems are still missing. This work presents SACRE (Smart Adaptation through Contextual REquirements), our approach leveraging an adaptation feedback loop to detect self-adaptive systems’ contextual requirements affected by uncertainty and to integrate machine learning techniques to determine the best operationalization of context based on sensed data at runtime. SACRE is a step forward of our former approach ACon which focus had been on adapting the context in contextual requirements, as well as their basic implementation. SACRE primarily focuses on architectural decisions, addressing self-adaptive systems’ engineering challenges. Furthering the work on ACon, in this paper, we perform an evaluation of the entire approach in different uncertainty scenarios in real-time in the extremely demanding domain of smart vehicles. The real-time evaluation is conducted in a simulated environment in which the smart vehicle is implemented through software components. The evaluation results provide empirical evidence about the applicability of SACRE in real and complex software system domains.

                            Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) typically operate in highly indeterminate environmental conditions, which require the development of testing methods that must explicitly consider uncertainty in test design, test generation, and test optimization. Towards this direction, we propose a set of uncertainty-wise test case generation and test case minimization strategies that rely on test ready models explicitly specifying subjective uncertainty. We propose two test case generation strategies and four test case minimization strategies based on the Uncertainty Theory and multi-objective search. These strategies include a novel methodology for designing and introducing indeterminacy sources in the environment during test execution and a novel set of uncertainty-wise test verdicts. We performed an extensive empirical study to select the best algorithm out of eight commonly used multi-objective search algorithms, for each of the four minimization strategies, with five use cases of two industrial CPS case studies. The minimized set of test cases obtained with the best algorithm for each minimization strategy were executed on the two real CPSs. The results showed that our best test strategy managed to observe 51% more uncertainties due to unknown indeterminate behaviors of the physical environments of the CPSs as compared to the other test strategies. Also, the same test strategy managed to observe 118% more unknown uncertainties as compared to the unique number of known uncertainties.

                            Context
														Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), when deployed for operation, are inherently prone to uncertainty. Considering their applications in critical domains (e.g., healthcare), it is important that such CPSs are tested sufficiently, with the explicit consideration of uncertainty. Model-based testing (MBT) involves creating test ready models capturing the expected behavior of a CPS and its operating environment. These test ready models are then used for generating executable test cases. It is, therefore, necessary to develop methods that can continuously evolve, based on real operational data collected during the operation of CPSs, test ready models and uncertainty captured in them, all together termed as Belief Test Ready Models (BMs)
														Objective
														Our objective is to propose a model evolution framework that can interactively improve the quality of BMs, based on operational data. Such BMs are developed by one or more test modelers (belief agents) with their assumptions about the expected behavior of a CPS, its expected physical environment, and potential future deployments. Thus, these models explicitly contain subjective uncertainty of the test modelers.
														Method
														We propose a framework (named as UncerTolve) for interactively evolving BMs (specified with extended UML notations) of CPSs with subjective uncertainty developed by test modelers. The key inputs of UncerTolve include initial BMs of CPSs with known subjective uncertainty and real data collected from the operation of CPSs. UncerTolve has three key features: 1) Validating the syntactic correctness and conformance of BMs against real operational data via model execution, 2) Evolving objective uncertainty measurements of BMs via model execution, and 3) Evolving state invariants (modeling test oracles) and guards of transitions (modeling constraints for test data generation) of BMs with a machine learning technique.
														Results
														As a proof-of-concept, we evaluated UncerTolve with one industrial CPS case study, i.e., GeoSports from the healthcare domain. Using UncerTolve, we managed to evolve 51% of belief elements, 18% of states, and 21% of transitions as compared to the initial BM developed in an industrial setting.
														Conclusion
														UncerTolve can successfully evolve model elements of the initial BM, in addition to objective uncertainty measurements using real operational data. The evolved model can be used to generate additional test cases covering evolved model elements and objective uncertainty. These additional test cases can be used to test the current and future deployments of a CPS to ensure that it will handle uncertainty gracefully during its operations.

                            It is important that a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with uncertainty in its behavior caused by its unpredictable operating environment, to ensure its reliable operation. One method to ensure that the CPS will handle such uncertainty during its operation is by testing the CPS with model-based testing (MBT) techniques. However, existing MBT techniques do not explicitly capture uncertainty in test ready models, i.e., capturing the uncertain expected behavior of a CPS in the presence of environment uncertainty. To fill this gap, we present an Uncertainty-Wise test-modeling framework, named as UncerTum, to create test ready models to support MBT of CPSs facing uncertainty. UncerTum relies on the definition of a UML profile [the UML Uncertainty Profile (UUP)] and a set of UML Model Libraries extending the UML profile for Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems (MARTE). UncerTum also benefits from the UML Testing Profile V.2 to support standard-based MBT. UncerTum was evaluated with two industrial CPS case studies, one real-world case study, and one open-source CPS case study from the following four perspectives: (1) Completeness and Coverage of the profiles and Model Libraries in terms of concepts defined in their underlying uncertainty conceptual model for CPSs, i.e., U-Model and MARTE, (2) Effort required to model uncertainty with UncerTum, and (3) Correctness of the developed test ready models, which was assessed via model execution. Based on the evaluation, we can conclude that we were successful in modeling all the uncertainties identified in the four case studies, which gives us an indication that UncerTum is sufficiently complete. In terms of modeling effort, we concluded that on average UncerTum requires 18.5% more time to apply stereotypes from UUP on test ready models.

                            Uncertainty is intrinsic in most technical systems, including Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, handling uncertainty in a graceful manner during the real operation of CPS is critical. Since designing, developing, and testing modern and highly sophisticated CPS is an expanding field, a step towards dealing with uncertainty is to identify, define, and classify uncertainties at various levels of CPS. This will help develop a systematic and comprehensive understanding of uncertainty. To that end, we propose a conceptual model for uncertainty specifically designed for CPS. Since the study of uncertainty in CPS development and testing is still irrelatively unexplored, this conceptual model was derived in a large part by reviewing existing work on uncertainty in other fields, including philosophy, physics, statistics, and healthcare. The conceptual model is mapped to the three logical levels of CPS: Application, Infrastructure, and Integration. It is captured using UML class diagrams, including relevant OCL constraints. To validate the conceptual model, we identified, classified, and specified uncertainties in two distinct industrial case studies.

               	   	Conventionally, the exposure regarding knowledge of the inter vehicle link duration is a significant parameter in Vehicular Networks to estimate the delay during the failure of a specific link during the transmission. However, the mobility and dynamics of the nodes is considerably higher in a smart city than on highways and thus could emerge a complex random pattern for the investigation of the link duration, referring all sorts of uncertain conditions. There are existing link duration estimation models, which perform linear operations under linear relationships without imprecise conditions. Anticipating, the requirement to tackle the uncertain conditions in Vehicular Networks, this paper presents a hybrid neural network-driven mobility prediction model. The proposed hybrid neural network comprises a Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann machine (FCBM), which allows the random patterns of several vehicles in a single time stamp to be learned. The several dynamic parameters, which may make the contexts of Vehicular Networks uncertain, could be vehicle speed at the moment of prediction, the number of leading vehicles, the average speed of the leading vehicle, the distance to the subsequent intersection of traffic roadways and the number of lanes in a road segment. In this paper, a novel method of hybrid intelligence is initiated to tackle such uncertainty. Here, the Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine (FCBM) is a stochastic graph model that can learn joint probability distribution over its visible units (say n) and hidden feature units (say m). It is evident that there must be a prime driving parameter of the holistic network, which will monitor the interconnection of weights and biases of the Vehicular Network for all these features. The highlight of this paper is that the prime driving parameter to control the learning process should be a fuzzy number, as fuzzy logic is used to represent the vague and uncertain parameters. Therefore, if uncertainty exists due to the random patterns caused by vehicle mobility, the proposed Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine could remove the noise from the data representation. Thus, the proposed model will be able to predict robustly the mobility in VANET, referring any instance of link failure under Vehicular Network paradigm.

                           Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems are usually composed of thousands of different components
                           among hardware devices and different software modules. In order to address the design of
                           these complex systems, different abstraction layers are usually defined. However, as these
                           layers are isolated, highlevel components always have uncertainty about the nature of the
                           low-level components they relate with. In particular, as low-level component identities are
                           not known by user applications, and current IoT systems are vulnerable to the injection of
                           new components and to the modification of the behavior of existing ones (adequate security
                           solutions at the network level for these problems have not been found yet), the reliability
                           of the received data is generally compromised. In this context, new mechanisms are required
                           to avoid the interactions or directly remove the malicious components relying on high-level
                           information. This paper describes a statistical framework to discover IoT components with
                           malicious behaviors, using a hybrid reputation model. On the one hand, an implicit reputation
                           definition is employed, based on the observations made by a certain IoT component and other
                           modules it relies on. On the other hand, an explicit reputation model considers a scheme of
                           recommendations and negative grades. The proposed solution is evaluated in a simulation
                           scenario by using the NS3 simulator, in order to perform an experimental validation.

            Localization underwater has been known to be challenging due to the limited accessibility of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to obtain absolute positions. This becomes more severe in the under-ice environment since the ocean surface is covered with ice, making it more difficult to access GPS or to deploy localization infrastructure. In this paper, a novel solution that minimizes localization uncertainty and communication overhead of under-ice Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is proposed. Existing underwater localization solutions generally rely on reference nodes at ocean surface or on localization infrastructure to calculate positions, and they are not able to estimate the localization uncertainty, which may lead to the increase of localization error. In contrast, using the notion of external uncertainty (i.e., the position uncertainty as seen by others), our solution can characterize an AUV’s position with a probability model. This model is further used to estimate the uncertainty associated with our proposed localization techniques. Based on this uncertainty estimate, we further propose algorithms to minimize localization uncertainty and communication overhead. Our solution is emulated and compared against existing solutions, showing improved performance.                </td>

                     Recently there has been increasing engineering activity in the deployment of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Different types of AUVs are being used for applications ranging from ocean exploration to coastal tactical surveillance. These AUVs generally follow a predictable trajectory specified by the mission requirements. Inaccuracies in models for deriving position estimates and the drift caused by ocean currents, however, lead to uncertainty when estimating an AUV’s position. In this article, two forms of position uncertainty – internal and external – are studied, which are the position uncertainty associated with a particular AUV as seen by itself and that as seen by others, respectively. Then, a statistical model to estimate the internal uncertainty for a general AUV is proposed. Based on this model, a novel mathematical framework using Unscented Kalman Filtering is developed to estimate the external uncertainty. Finally, the benefits of this framework for several location-sensitive applications are shown via emulations.                </td>

                                    This keynote talk and paper intend to motivate research projects that investigate novel ways to model, analyze, and mitigate uncertainty arising in three different aspects of the cyber-physical systems. First, uncertainty about the physical environment can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes catastrophic, results as the system tries to adapt to unanticipated or poorly-understood environmental conditions. Second, uncertainty in the cyber environment can have lead to unexpected and adverse effects, including not only performance impacts (load, traffic, etc.) but also potential threats or overt attacks. Finally, uncertainty can exist with the components themselves and how they interact upon reconfiguration, including unexpected and unwanted feature interactions. Each of these sources of uncertainty can potentially be identified at different stages, respectively run time, design time, and requirements, but their mitigation might be done at the same or a different stage. Based on the related literature and our preliminary investigations, we argue that the following three overarching techniques are essential and warrant further research to provide enabling technologies to address uncertainty at all three stages: model-based development, assurance, and dynamic adaptation. Furthermore, we posit that in order to go beyond incremental improvements to current software engineering techniques, we need to leverage, extend, and integrate techniques from other disciplines.                </td>

                The ever-growing complexity of software systems coupled with their stringent availability requirements are challenging the manual management of software after its deployment. This has motivated the development of self-adaptive software systems. Self-adaptation endows a software system with the ability to satisfy certain objectives by automatically modifying its behavior at runtime. While many promising approaches for the construction of self-adaptive software systems have been developed, the majority of them ignore the uncertainty underlying the adaptation. This has been one of the key inhibitors to widespread adoption of self-adaption techniques in risk-averse real-world applications. Uncertainty in this setting is a vaguely understood term. In this paper, we characterize the sources of uncertainty in self-adaptive software system, and demonstrate its impact on the system’s ability to satisfy its objectives. We then provide an alternative notion of optimality that explicitly incorporates the uncertainty underlying the knowledge (models) used for decision making. We discuss the state-of-the-art for dealing with uncertainty in this setting, and conclude with a set of challenges, which provide a road map for future research.

               	   	Self-adaptive software-intensive cyber-physical systems (sasiCPS) encounter a high level of run-time uncertainty. State-of-the-art architecture-based self-adaptation approaches assume designing against a fixed set of situations that warrant self-adaptation. As a result, failures may appear when sasiCPS operate in environment conditions they are not specifically designed for. In response, we propose to increase the homeostasis of sasiCPS, i.e., the capacity to maintain an operational state despite run-time uncertainty, by introducing run-time changes to the architecture-based self-adaptation strategies according to environment stimuli. In addition to articulating the main idea of architectural homeostasis, we introduce four mechanisms that reify the idea: (i) collaborative sensing, (ii) faulty component isolation from adaptation, (iii) enhancing mode switching, and (iv) adjusting guards in mode switching. Moreover, our experimental evaluation of the four mechanisms in two different case studies confirms that allowing a complex system to change its self-adaptation strategies helps the system recover from run-time errors and abnormalities and keep it in an operational state.

						In recent years, expectations for large-scale wireless sensor networks have been rapidly increased due to miniaturization, cost reduction, reduction in power consumption of wireless sensor devices, and the emergence of wireless sensor network applications such as IoT (Internet Of Things). However, in addition to the uncertainty inherent in wireless sensor networks, due to the uncertainty caused by the expansion of wireless sensor networks, it is not easy to realize a highly efficient and reliable large-scale wireless sensor network. The uncertainty of wireless sensor networks is classified into three types: the uncertainty of nodes such as sensor nodes and sink nodes, the uncertainty of wireless communication links among nodes, and the uncertainty of traffic transferred over the wireless sensor network. In this paper, as a wireless communication standard, we focus on IEEE 802.15.4, which is designed for short-range wireless networks called PANs (Personal Area Networks), and analyze large-scale wireless sensor networks using fluid approximation. Specifically, IEEE 802.15.4 large-scale wireless sensor networks are analyzed by extending the modeling approach for generic CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) wireless networks. Moreover, our analysis makes it possible to probabilistically model temporal fluctuation of wireless communication ranges of nodes as network uncertainty. As a result, our analysis clarifies the effect of link uncertainty on the average message delivery delay in wireless sensor networks.

               	   		The integration of physical systems through computing and networking has become pervasive, a trend now known as cyber-physical systems (CPS). Functionality in CPS emerges from the interaction of networked computational and physical objects. System design and integration are particularly challenging because fundamentally different physical and computational design concerns intersect. The impact of these interactions is the loss of compositionality which creates tremendous challenges. The key idea in this article is to use passivity for decoupling the control design of networked systems from uncertainties such as time delays and packet loss, thus providing a fundamental simplification strategy that limits the complexity of interactions. The main contribution is the application of the approach to an experimental case study of a networked multi-robot system. We present a networked control architecture that ensures the overall system remains stable in spite of implementation uncertainties such as network delays and data dropouts, focusing on the technical details required for the implementation. We describe a prototype domain-specific modeling language and automated code generation tools for the design of networked control systems on top of passivity that facilitate effective system configuration, deployment, and testing. Finally, we present experimental evaluation results that show decoupling of interlayer interactions.

                                This paper develops a model-based framework for the quantification and propagation of multiple uncertainty sources affecting the performance of a smart system. A smart system, in general, performs sensing, control and actuation for proper functioning of a physical subsystem (also referred to as a plant). With strong feedback coupling between several subsystems, the uncertainty in the quantities of interest (QoI) amplifies over time. The coupling in a generic smart system occurs at two levels: (1) coupling between individual subsystems (plant, cyber, actuation, sensors), and (2) coupling between nodes in a distributed computational subsystem. In this paper, a coupled smart system is decoupled and considered as a feed-forward system over time and modeled using a two-level Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), one at each level of coupling (between subsystems and between nodes). A DBN can aggregate uncertainty from multiple sources within a time step and across time steps. The DBN associated with a smart system can be learned using available system models, physics models and data. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for the design of a smart indoor heating system (identification of sensors and a wireless network) within cost constraints that enables room-by-room temperature control. We observe that sensor uncertainty has a higher impact on the performance of the heating system compared to the uncertainty in the wireless network.

                                Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are expected to continuously monitor the physical components to autonomously calculate appropriate runtime reactions to deal with the uncertain environmental conditions. Self-adaptation, as a promising concept to fulfill a set of provable rules, majorly needs runtime quantitative verification (RQV). Taking a few probabilistic variables into account to represent the uncertainties, the system configuration will be extremely large. Thus, efficient approaches are needed to reduce the model state-space, preferably with certain bounds on the approximation error. In this paper, we propose an approximation framework to efficiently approximate the entire model of a self-adaptive system. We split up the large model into strongly-connected components (SCCs), apply the approximation algorithm separately on each SCC, and integrate the result of each part using a centralized algorithm. Due to a number of changes in probabilistic variables, it is not possible to use static models. Addressing this issue, we have deployed parametric Markov decision process. In order to apply approximation on the model, the notion of ε-approximate probabilistic bisimulation is utilized that introduces the approximation level ε. We show that our approximation framework offers a certain error bound on each level of approximation. Then, we denote that the approximation framework is appropriate to be applied in decision-making process of self-adaptive systems where the models are relatively large. The results reveal that we can achieve up to 50% size reduction in the approximate model while maintaining the accuracy about 95%. In addition, we discuss about the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy of our approximation framework.

                                A challenging issue in the architectural design of a System-of-Systems (SoS) is how to cope with the uncertainty raised by the limited knowledge of the operational environment where the SoS will actually be deployed as well as the constituent systems which will concretely participate in the SoS at run-time. It is especially the case of SoSs being architected on the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Indeed, due to the open and dynamic nature of the IoT, on the one hand, at design-time, most often the SoS architects do not know which will be the concrete IoT systems that will become constituents of an SoS, these being predominantly identified at run-time; on the other hand, the correct architecture depends not only on the constituent IoT systems but also, largely, on the operational environment where the SoS will be positioned on the IoT. The consequent research question is thereby how to design and describe the SoS architecture in a way that is flexible enough to cope with these different uncertainties. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the notion of uncertainty in SoS and presents how SosADL, a formal SoS Architecture Description Language (ADL), enables to cope with uncertainty in the architecture modeling of SoSs. It presents the concepts and constructs that makes possible to describe SoS architectures which will operate in unpredictable environments on the IoT based on the SosADL support for dealing with partial knowledge, grounded on concurrent constraints.

                                Many Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are composed of low-cost devices that are deeply integrated with physical environments. As a result, the performance of a CPS system is inevitably undermined by various physical uncertainties, which include stochastic noises, hardware biases, unpredictable environment changes, and dynamics of the physical process of interest. Traditional solutions to these issues (e.g., device calibration and collaborative signal processing) work in an open-loop fashion and hence often fail to adapt to the uncertainties after system deployment. In this article, we propose an adaptive system-level calibration approach for a class of CPS systems whose primary objective is to detect events or targets of interest. Through collaborative data fusion, our calibration approach features a feedback control loop that exploits system heterogeneity to mitigate the impact of aforementioned uncertainties on the system performance. In contrast to existing heuristic-based solutions, our control-theoretical calibration algorithm can ensure provable system stability and convergence. We also develop a routing algorithm for fusion-based multihop CPS systems that is robust to communication unreliability and delay. Our approach is evaluated by both experiments on a testbed of Tmotes as well as extensive simulations based on data traces gathered from a real vehicle detection experiment. The results demonstrate that our calibration algorithm enables a CPS system to maintain the optimal sensing performance in the presence of various system and environmental dynamics.

                                A new context-aware data- and patient-centric paradigm for ubiquitous healthcare is central to deliver personalized healthcare solutions to the elderly and the physically challenged. However, this new paradigm requires real-time in-the-field processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models and analysis of the processed information (derived physiological parameters) under context (e.g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, an innovative resource provisioning framework that harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., smart phones, laptops, tablets, DVRs, medical terminals) to form a mobile computing grid is presented. The framework is imparted with self-optimization and self-healing capabilities for efficiency and robustness under uncertainty, respectively. The proposed mobile grid management framework serves as a key enabling technology for Internet-of-Things- (IoT-) based next-generation ubiquitous healthcare solutions.

                            Uncertainty is intrinsic in most technical systems, including Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, handling uncertainty in a graceful manner during the real operation of CPS is critical. Since designing, developing, and testing modern and highly sophisticated CPS is an expanding field, a step towards dealing with uncertainty is to identify, define, and classify uncertainties at various levels of CPS. This will help develop a systematic and comprehensive understanding of uncertainty. To that end, we propose a conceptual model for uncertainty specifically designed for CPS. Since the study of uncertainty in CPS development and testing is still irrelatively unexplored, this conceptual model was derived in a large part by reviewing existing work on uncertainty in other fields, including philosophy, physics, statistics, and healthcare. The conceptual model is mapped to the three logical levels of CPS: Application, Infrastructure, and Integration. It is captured using UML class diagrams, including relevant OCL constraints. To validate the conceptual model, we identified, classified, and specified uncertainties in two distinct industrial case studies.

                           household. Current researches are more focused on the sheer technological (e.g., protocol
                           design, routing, data fusion, etc), but the defect of the current incomplete information
                           observation and others technical gaps makes it difficult to design a practical Smart Home
                           system for complex applications, such as scene identification, smart surveillance, even
                           output for the occupants' interest-oriented services. In this paper we design a Smart Home
                           reasoning scenario, which use the knowledge in the form of Event-Condition-Action rules, and
                           together with an efficient inference scheme which incorporates reasoning with uncertainty.

                This paper considers a synthetic counter-measure, combining transmission scheduling and defensive deception, to defend against jamming attacks in remote state estimation. In the setup studied, an attacker sabotages packet transmissions from a sensor to a remote estimator by congesting the communication channel between them. In order to efficiently degrade the estimation accuracy, the intelligent attacker tailors its jamming strategy by reacting to the real-time information it collects. In response to the jamming attacks, the sensor with a long-term goal will select the transmission power level at each stage. In addition, by modifying the real-time information intentionally, the sensor creates asymmetric uncertainty to mislead the attacker and thus mitigate attacks. Considering the dynamic nature of the process, we model the strategic interaction between the sensor and the attacker by a general stochastic game with asymmetric information structure. To obtain stationary optimal strategies for each player, we convert this game into a belief-based dynamic game and analyze the existence of its optimal solution. For a tractable implementation, we present an algorithm that finds equilibrium strategies based on multi-agent reinforcement learning for symmetric-information stochastic games. Numerical examples illustrate properties of the proposed algorithm.

                        Event processing follows a decoupled model of interaction in space, time, and synchronization. However, another dimension of semantic coupling also exists and poses a challenge to the scalability of event processing systems in highly semantically heterogeneous and dynamic environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Current state-of-the-art approaches of content-based and concept-based event systems require a significant agreement between event producers and consumers on event schema or an external conceptual model of event semantics. Thus, they do not address the semantic coupling issue. This article proposes an approach where participants only agree on a distributional statistical model of semantics represented in a corpus of text to derive semantic similarity and relatedness. It also proposes an approximate model for relaxing the semantic coupling dimension via an approximation-enabled rule language and an approximate event matcher. The model is formalized as an ensemble of semantic and top-k matchers along with a probability model for uncertainty management. The model has been empirically validated on large sets of events and subscriptions synthesized from real-world smart city and energy management systems. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves more than 95% F1Score of effectiveness and thousands of events/sec of throughput for medium degrees of approximation while not requiring users to have complete prior knowledge of event semantics. In semantically loosely-coupled environments, one approximate subscription can compensate for hundreds of exact subscriptions to cover all possibilities in environments which require complete prior knowledge of event semantics. Results indicate that approximate semantic event processing could play a promising role in the IoT middleware layer.

                                With the rapid advances in sensing and digital technologies, cyber-physical systems are regarded as the most viable platforms for improving building design and management. Researchers investigated the possibility of integrating energy management systems with cyber-physical systems to form energy-cyber-physical systems in order to promote building energy management. However, minimizing energy consumption while fulfilling building functions for energy-cyber-physical systems is challenging due to the dynamics of building occupants. As occupant behavior is a major source of uncertainty for energy management, ignoring it often results in both energy waste caused by overheating and overcooling as well as discomfort due to insufficient thermal and ventilation services. To mitigate such uncertainties, this study proposes an occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical system that incorporates WiFi probe-based occupancy detection. The proposed framework utilizes ensemble classification algorithms to extract three forms of occupancy information. It creates a data interface to link energy management systems and cyber-physical systems and allows for automated occupancy detection and interpretation by assembling multiple weak classifiers for WiFi signals. A validation experiment in a large office room was conducted to examine the performance of the proposed occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical systems. The experiment and simulation results suggest that, with a proper classifier and occupancy data type, the proposed model can potentially save about 26.4% of energy consumption in cooling and ventilation demands.

                            Uncertainty is intrinsic in most technical systems, including Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, handling uncertainty in a graceful manner during the real operation of CPS is critical. Since designing, developing, and testing modern and highly sophisticated CPS is an expanding field, a step towards dealing with uncertainty is to identify, define, and classify uncertainties at various levels of CPS. This will help develop a systematic and comprehensive understanding of uncertainty. To that end, we propose a conceptual model for uncertainty specifically designed for CPS. Since the study of uncertainty in CPS development and testing is still irrelatively unexplored, this conceptual model was derived in a large part by reviewing existing work on uncertainty in other fields, including philosophy, physics, statistics, and healthcare. The conceptual model is mapped to the three logical levels of CPS: Application, Infrastructure, and Integration. It is captured using UML class diagrams, including relevant OCL constraints. To validate the conceptual model, we identified, classified, and specified uncertainties in two distinct industrial case studies.

                    This paper presents a stochastic programming approach, using a risk measure defined by conditional value-at-risk, for trading solar energy in a market environment under uncertainty. Uncertainties on electricity price and solar irradiation are considered through a set of scenarios computed by simulation and scenario-reduction. The short-term operation problem of a concentrating solar power plant is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, which allows modelling the discrete status of the plant. To improve the operational productivity of the plant during the non-insulation periods, energy storage systems are considered. The goal is to obtain the optimal operation planning that maximizes the total expected profits while evaluating trading risks. For risk evaluation, the conditional value-at-risk is used to maximize the expected profits of the least profitable scenarios. A case study is used to illustrate the usefulness and the proficiency of the proposed approach.

               	   	The smart electric grid in the United States is one of the largest and most complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) in the world and contains considerable uncertainties. Probabilistic optimal power flow (OPF) analysis is required to accomplish the electrical and economic operational goals. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to accelerate the computation of probabilistic OPF for large-scale smart grids through network reduction (NR). Cumulant-based method and Gram-Charlier expansion theory are used to efficiently obtain the statistics of system states. We develop a more accurate linear mapping method to compute the unknown cumulants. Our method speeds up the computation by up to 4.57X and can improve around 30% accuracy when Hessian matrix is ill-conditioned compared to the previous approach.

                               A critical issue in the Web of Things (WoT) is the need to process and analyze the interactions of Web-interconnected real-world objects. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a powerful technology for analyzing streams of information about real-time distributed events, coming from different sources, and for extracting conclusions from them. However, in many situations these events are not free from uncertainty, due to either unreliable data sources and networks, measurement uncertainty, or to the inability to determine whether an event has actually happened or not. This short research paper discusses how CEP systems can incorporate different kinds of uncertainty, both in the events and in the rules. A case study is used to validate the proposal, and we discuss the benefits and limitations of this CEP extension.

                                This paper develops a model-based framework for the quantification and propagation of multiple uncertainty sources affecting the performance of a smart system. A smart system, in general, performs sensing, control and actuation for proper functioning of a physical subsystem (also referred to as a plant). With strong feedback coupling between several subsystems, the uncertainty in the quantities of interest (QoI) amplifies over time. The coupling in a generic smart system occurs at two levels: (1) coupling between individual subsystems (plant, cyber, actuation, sensors), and (2) coupling between nodes in a distributed computational subsystem. In this paper, a coupled smart system is decoupled and considered as a feed-forward system over time and modeled using a two-level Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), one at each level of coupling (between subsystems and between nodes). A DBN can aggregate uncertainty from multiple sources within a time step and across time steps. The DBN associated with a smart system can be learned using available system models, physics models and data. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for the design of a smart indoor heating system (identification of sensors and a wireless network) within cost constraints that enables room-by-room temperature control. We observe that sensor uncertainty has a higher impact on the performance of the heating system compared to the uncertainty in the wireless network.

                               Internet of Things devices, such as video-based detectors or road side units are being deployed in emerging applications like sustainable and intelligent transportation systems. Oftentimes, stringent operation and energy cost constraints are exerted on this type of applications, necessitating a hybrid supply of renewable and grid energy. The key issue of a cost-constrained hybrid of renewable and grid power is its uncertainty in energy availability. The characteristic of approximate computation that accepts an approximate result when energy is limited and executes more computations yielding better results if more energy is available, can be exploited to intelligently handle the uncertainty. In this paper, we first propose an energy-adaptive task allocation scheme that optimally assigns real-time approximate-computation tasks to individual processors and subsequently enables a matching of the cost-constrained hybrid supply of energy with the energy demand of the resultant task schedule. We then present a quality of service (QoS)-driven task scheduling scheme that determines the optional execution cycles of tasks on individual processors for optimization of system QoS. A dynamic task scheduling scheme is also designed to adapt at runtime the task execution to the varying amount of the available energy. Simulation results show that our schemes can reduce system energy consumption by up to 29% and improve system QoS by up to 108% as compared to benchmarking algorithms.

                            The intelligent manufacturing strategy and customer demand have mutually promoted each other. Also, the production mode is shifting towards customized production, and more rental resources or services are introduced to the production system, therefore, the systems are becoming more complex. Compared with traditional production systems, such systems have some new features, this work calls this type of system as a synchronized production operation system (SPOS). Under such circumstances, production systems are influenced by more frequent uncertainties, and the planning-based production decision and control approach is no longer applicable. The opti-state control (OsC) method is proposed to help SPOS keep in an optimal state when uncertainties affect the system. Besides, a digital twin-based control framework (DTCF) is designed for getting the full element information needed for decision making. Based on the comprehensive information of the production system obtained by the DTCF, the OsC method is introduced to the virtual control layer to formulate the optimal target guiding the path of the system in real time through the dynamic matching mechanism (qualitative perspective). Then multi-stage synchronized control with analysis target cascading (ATC) method is used to get the local optimal state decisions (quantitative perspective). From both qualitative and quantitative aspects to ensure the system is under an optimal target path for optimal operation procedure. At last, a case study in a large-size paint making company in China is used to validate the effectiveness of the approach.

                            Uncertainty is intrinsic in most technical systems, including Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, handling uncertainty in a graceful manner during the real operation of CPS is critical. Since designing, developing, and testing modern and highly sophisticated CPS is an expanding field, a step towards dealing with uncertainty is to identify, define, and classify uncertainties at various levels of CPS. This will help develop a systematic and comprehensive understanding of uncertainty. To that end, we propose a conceptual model for uncertainty specifically designed for CPS. Since the study of uncertainty in CPS development and testing is still irrelatively unexplored, this conceptual model was derived in a large part by reviewing existing work on uncertainty in other fields, including philosophy, physics, statistics, and healthcare. The conceptual model is mapped to the three logical levels of CPS: Application, Infrastructure, and Integration. It is captured using UML class diagrams, including relevant OCL constraints. To validate the conceptual model, we identified, classified, and specified uncertainties in two distinct industrial case studies.

                            Self-adaptation is an established approach to deal with uncertainties that are difficult to predict before a system is deployed. A self-adaptative system employs a feedback loop that tracks changes and adapts the system accordingly to ensure its quality goals. However, making effective adaptation decisions at runtime is challenging. In this chapter we tackle two problems of effective decision making in self-adaptive systems. First, current research typically focusses on the benefits adaptaton can bring but ignores the cost of adaptation, which may invalidate the expected benefits. To tackle this problem, we introduce CB@R (Cost-Benefit analysis @ Runtime), a novel model-based approach for runtime decision-making in self-adaptive systems that handles both the benefits and costs of adaptation as first-class citizens in decision making. Second, we look into the adaptation space of self-adaptive systems, i.e. the set of adaption options to select from. For systems with a large number of adaptation options, analyzing the entire adaptation space is often not feasible given the time and resources constraints at hand. To tackle this problem, we present a machine learning approach that integrates learning with the feedback loop to select a subset of the adaption options that are valid in the current situation. We evaluate CB@R and the learning approach for a real world deployed Internet of Things (IoT) application.

               	   	  The electric grid had become a vast complex cyber-physical system, and its digitalization is a reality in the close future that would result in a tremendous amount of information, controls, and uncertainties. Distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed generation (DG), demand response (DR), distributed energy storage systems (DESS), and electric vehicle (EV) are increasing the level of uncertainty but also the capabilities of new controls on the distribution networks. The future electric grid will need more flexibility and coordination between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to be able to operate in a reliable, secure and economical fashion. To overcome uncertainties and reliability issues, DSO is moving toward the so-called active distribution network (ADN) which is the crucial piece of for enabling new flexibility at the TSO level. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the estimation of the ADNs flexibility based on the feasibility region at the TSO-DSO interface. A Monte Carlo sampling method is applied to generate random ADN states. The proposed methodology is analyzed in both the 5-bus ring distribution test system and the 33-bus IEEE radial distribution system.

                           Modern automotive vehicles represent one category of CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems) that are inherently time- and safety-critical. To justify the actions for quality-of-service adaptation and safety assurance, it is fundamental to perceive the uncertainties of system components in operation, which are caused by emergent properties, design or operation anomalies. From an industrial point of view, a further challenge is related to the usages of generic purpose COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) components, which are separately developed and evolved, often not sufficiently verified and validated for specific automotive contexts. While introducing additional uncertainties in regard to the overall system performance and safety, the adoption of COTS components constitutes a necessary means for effective product evolution and innovation. Accordingly, we propose in this paper a novel approach that aims to enable advanced operation monitoring and self-assessment in regard to operational uncertainties and thereby automated performance and safety awareness. The emphasis is on the integration of several modeling technologies, including the domain-specific modeling framework EAST-ADL, the A-G contract theory and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In particular, we also present some initial concepts in regard to the usage performance and safety awareness for quality-of-service adaptation and dynamic risk mitigation.                </td>

                     This keynote talk and paper intend to motivate research projects that investigate novel ways to model, analyze, and mitigate uncertainty arising in three different aspects of the cyber-physical systems. First, uncertainty about the physical environment can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes catastrophic, results as the system tries to adapt to unanticipated or poorly-understood environmental conditions. Second, uncertainty in the cyber environment can have lead to unexpected and adverse effects, including not only performance impacts (load, traffic, etc.) but also potential threats or overt attacks. Finally, uncertainty can exist with the components themselves and how they interact upon reconfiguration, including unexpected and unwanted feature interactions. Each of these sources of uncertainty can potentially be identified at different stages, respectively run time, design time, and requirements, but their mitigation might be done at the same or a different stage. Based on the related literature and our preliminary investigations, we argue that the following three overarching techniques are essential and warrant further research to provide enabling technologies to address uncertainty at all three stages: model-based development, assurance, and dynamic adaptation. Furthermore, we posit that in order to go beyond incremental improvements to current software engineering techniques, we need to leverage, extend, and integrate techniques from other disciplines.                </td>

               	   Self-healing cyber-physical systems (SH-CPSs) detect and recover from faults by themselves at runtime. Testing such systems is challenging due to the complex implementation of self-healing behaviors and their interaction with the physical environment, both of which are uncertain. To this end, we propose an executable model-based approach to test self-healing behaviors under environmental uncertainties. The approach consists of a Modeling Framework of SH-CPSs (MoSH) and an accompanying Test Model Executor (TM-Executor). MoSH provides a set of modeling constructs and a methodology to specify executable test models, which capture expected system behaviors and environmental uncertainties. TM-Executor executes the test models together with the systems under test, to dynamically test their self-healing behaviors under uncertainties. We demonstrated the successful application of MoSH to specify 11 self-healing behaviors and 17 uncertainties for three SH-CPSs. The time spent by TM-Executor to perform testing activities was in the order of milliseconds, though the time spent was strongly correlated with the complexity of test models.

               	   Self-healing is becoming an essential behavior of smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), which enables them to recover from faults by themselves. Such behaviors make decisions autonomously at runtime and they often operate in an uncertain physical environment making testing even more challenging. To this end, we propose Fragility-Oriented Testing (FOT), which relies on model execution and reinforcement learning to cost-effectively test self-healing behaviors of CPSs in the presence of environmental uncertainty. We evaluated FOT’s performance by comparing it with a Coverage-Oriented Testing (COT) algorithm. Evaluation results show that FOT significantly outperformed COT for testing nine self-healing behaviors implemented in three case studies. On average, FOT managed to find 80% more faults than COT and for cases when both FOT and COT found the same faults, FOT took on average 50% less time than COT.

                                This paper develops a model-based framework for the quantification and propagation of multiple uncertainty sources affecting the performance of a smart system. A smart system, in general, performs sensing, control and actuation for proper functioning of a physical subsystem (also referred to as a plant). With strong feedback coupling between several subsystems, the uncertainty in the quantities of interest (QoI) amplifies over time. The coupling in a generic smart system occurs at two levels: (1) coupling between individual subsystems (plant, cyber, actuation, sensors), and (2) coupling between nodes in a distributed computational subsystem. In this paper, a coupled smart system is decoupled and considered as a feed-forward system over time and modeled using a two-level Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), one at each level of coupling (between subsystems and between nodes). A DBN can aggregate uncertainty from multiple sources within a time step and across time steps. The DBN associated with a smart system can be learned using available system models, physics models and data. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for the design of a smart indoor heating system (identification of sensors and a wireless network) within cost constraints that enables room-by-room temperature control. We observe that sensor uncertainty has a higher impact on the performance of the heating system compared to the uncertainty in the wireless network.

               	   			Due to the uncertainty of what actual adaptations will be performed at run time, verifying adaptive systems at design time may lead to limited results or may even be infeasible. Run-time verification techniques have been proposed to cope with this uncertainty. Recently, there has been an increasing interest to use model checking (an important verification technique) at run time in order to verify the expected properties of adaptive systems. Given a system specification and expected system properties, a model checker determines whether or not the specification satisfies its properties in the presence of self-adaptation. One key concern is the generally high resource needs of model checking, which may prohibit its use on resource- and power-constrained devices, such as smart-phones or Internet-of-Things devices. To address this challenge, we introduce a cloud-based framework that delivers model checking as a service (MCaaS). MCaaS offloads computationally intensive model checking tasks to the cloud, thereby offering verification capabilities on demand. Adaptive systems running on any kind of connected device may take the advantages of model checking at run time by invoking the MCaaS service. To dynamically allocate the required cloud resources (CPU and memory), we employ machine learning to estimate the resource usage of an actual model checking task at run time. As proof of concept, we implement and validate the approach for the case of probabilistic model checking, which facilitates verifying typical properties such as reliability.

                                A new context-aware data- and patient-centric paradigm for ubiquitous healthcare is central to deliver personalized healthcare solutions to the elderly and the physically challenged. However, this new paradigm requires real-time in-the-field processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models and analysis of the processed information (derived physiological parameters) under context (e.g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, an innovative resource provisioning framework that harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., smart phones, laptops, tablets, DVRs, medical terminals) to form a mobile computing grid is presented. The framework is imparted with self-optimization and self-healing capabilities for efficiency and robustness under uncertainty, respectively. The proposed mobile grid management framework serves as a key enabling technology for Internet-of-Things- (IoT-) based next-generation ubiquitous healthcare solutions.

                                With the rapid advances in sensing and digital technologies, cyber-physical systems are regarded as the most viable platforms for improving building design and management. Researchers investigated the possibility of integrating energy management systems with cyber-physical systems to form energy-cyber-physical systems in order to promote building energy management. However, minimizing energy consumption while fulfilling building functions for energy-cyber-physical systems is challenging due to the dynamics of building occupants. As occupant behavior is a major source of uncertainty for energy management, ignoring it often results in both energy waste caused by overheating and overcooling as well as discomfort due to insufficient thermal and ventilation services. To mitigate such uncertainties, this study proposes an occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical system that incorporates WiFi probe-based occupancy detection. The proposed framework utilizes ensemble classification algorithms to extract three forms of occupancy information. It creates a data interface to link energy management systems and cyber-physical systems and allows for automated occupancy detection and interpretation by assembling multiple weak classifiers for WiFi signals. A validation experiment in a large office room was conducted to examine the performance of the proposed occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical systems. The experiment and simulation results suggest that, with a proper classifier and occupancy data type, the proposed model can potentially save about 26.4% of energy consumption in cooling and ventilation demands.

                             Runtime uncertainty such as unpredictable resource unavailability, changing environmental conditions and user needs, as well as system intrusions or faults represents one of the main current challenges of self-adaptive systems. Moreover, today's systems are increasingly more complex, distributed, decentralized, etc. and therefore have to reason about and cope with more and more unpredictable events. Approaches to deal with such changing requirements in complex today's systems are still missing. This work presents SACRE (Smart Adaptation through Contextual REquirements), our approach leveraging an adaptation feedback loop to detect self-adaptive systems’ contextual requirements affected by uncertainty and to integrate machine learning techniques to determine the best operationalization of context based on sensed data at runtime. SACRE is a step forward of our former approach ACon which focus had been on adapting the context in contextual requirements, as well as their basic implementation. SACRE primarily focuses on architectural decisions, addressing self-adaptive systems’ engineering challenges. Furthering the work on ACon, in this paper, we perform an evaluation of the entire approach in different uncertainty scenarios in real-time in the extremely demanding domain of smart vehicles. The real-time evaluation is conducted in a simulated environment in which the smart vehicle is implemented through software components. The evaluation results provide empirical evidence about the applicability of SACRE in real and complex software system domains.

                            Uncertainty is intrinsic in most technical systems, including Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, handling uncertainty in a graceful manner during the real operation of CPS is critical. Since designing, developing, and testing modern and highly sophisticated CPS is an expanding field, a step towards dealing with uncertainty is to identify, define, and classify uncertainties at various levels of CPS. This will help develop a systematic and comprehensive understanding of uncertainty. To that end, we propose a conceptual model for uncertainty specifically designed for CPS. Since the study of uncertainty in CPS development and testing is still irrelatively unexplored, this conceptual model was derived in a large part by reviewing existing work on uncertainty in other fields, including philosophy, physics, statistics, and healthcare. The conceptual model is mapped to the three logical levels of CPS: Application, Infrastructure, and Integration. It is captured using UML class diagrams, including relevant OCL constraints. To validate the conceptual model, we identified, classified, and specified uncertainties in two distinct industrial case studies.

                            Self-adaptation is an established approach to deal with uncertainties that are difficult to predict before a system is deployed. A self-adaptative system employs a feedback loop that tracks changes and adapts the system accordingly to ensure its quality goals. However, making effective adaptation decisions at runtime is challenging. In this chapter we tackle two problems of effective decision making in self-adaptive systems. First, current research typically focusses on the benefits adaptaton can bring but ignores the cost of adaptation, which may invalidate the expected benefits. To tackle this problem, we introduce CB@R (Cost-Benefit analysis @ Runtime), a novel model-based approach for runtime decision-making in self-adaptive systems that handles both the benefits and costs of adaptation as first-class citizens in decision making. Second, we look into the adaptation space of self-adaptive systems, i.e. the set of adaption options to select from. For systems with a large number of adaptation options, analyzing the entire adaptation space is often not feasible given the time and resources constraints at hand. To tackle this problem, we present a machine learning approach that integrates learning with the feedback loop to select a subset of the adaption options that are valid in the current situation. We evaluate CB@R and the learning approach for a real world deployed Internet of Things (IoT) application.

               	   	    The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices within homes raises many security and privacy concerns. Recent headlines highlight the lack of effective security mechanisms in IoT devices. Security threats in IoT arise not only from vulnerabilities in individual devices but also from the composition of devices in unanticipated ways and the ability of devices to interact through both cyber and physical channels. Existing approaches provide methods for monitoring cyber interactions between devices but fail to consider possible physical interactions. To overcome this challenge, it is essential that security assessments of IoT networks take a holistic view of the network and treat it as a "system of systems", in which security is defined, not solely by the individual systems, but also by the interactions and trust dependencies between systems.
                        In this paper, we propose a way of modeling cyber and physical interactions between IoT devices of a given network. By verifying the cyber and physical interactions against user-defined policies, our model can identify unexpected chains of events that may be harmful. It can also be applied to determine the impact of the addition (or removal) of a device into an existing network with respect to dangerous device interactions.
                        We demonstrate the viability of our approach by instantiating our model using Alloy, a language and tool for relational models. In our evaluation, we considered three realistic IoT use cases and demonstrate that our model is capable of identifying potentially dangerous device interactions. We also measure the performance of our approach with respect to the CPU runtime and memory consumption of the Alloy model finder, and show that it is acceptable for smart-home IoT networks.

               	   	  Internet of Things (IoT) data analytics is underpinning numerous applications, however, the task is still challenging predominantly due to heterogeneous IoT data streams, unreliable networks, and ever increasing size of the data. In this context, we propose a two-layer architecture for analyzing IoT data. The first layer provides a generic interface using a service oriented gateway to ingest data from multiple interfaces and IoT systems, store it in a scalable manner and analyze it in real-time to extract high-level events; whereas second layer is responsible for probabilistic fusion of these high-level events. In the second layer, we extend state-of-the-art event processing using Bayesian networks in order to take uncertainty into account while detecting complex events. We implement our proposed solution using open source components optimized for large-scale applications. We demonstrate our solution on real-world use-case in the domain of intelligent transportation system where we analyzed traffic, weather, and social media data streams from Madrid city in order to predict probability of congestion in real-time. The performance of the system is evaluated qualitatively using a web-interface where traffic administrators can provide the feedback about the quality of predictions and quantitatively using F-measure with an accuracy of over 80%.

               	   	Having a shared and accurate sense of time is critical to distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols, it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed systems with unprecedented accuracy. However, applications have not benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services that help manage time, and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces through which timing information flows to the application. Due to the importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications, running on commodity platforms and operating systems, it is imperative to rethink how time is handled across the system stack. We advocate the adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time (QoT) that captures metrics such as resolution, accuracy, and stability. Building on this notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time is a controllable operating system primitive with observable uncertainty, and where time synchronization balances applications' timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth. Our architecture features an expressive application programming interface that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline - a virtual temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide its components with a shared sense of time, with a desired accuracy and resolution. The timeline abstraction enables developers to easily write applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space. Leveraging open source hardware and software components, we have implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform. Results from its evaluation are also presented.

               	   	For an effective use of a robotic prosthetic, smooth transition between the states of this human-in-the-loop cyber-physical system (or autonomous operation) is crucial. In order to achieve that, taking into account the uncertainties in the robotic system may be as significant as anticipating the human intent. In this study, we present two risk measures associated with a simple grasping task based on the pre-grasp position and orientation of the robotic hand, and analyze them by using a model of a dexterous mechatronic prosthetic arm to simulate a simple grasping task. Moreover, we develop a hybrid position and force grasp controller and use a grasp quality metric to assess the grasps. 34 simulations with different pre-grasp poses were performed to investigate the relationship between the grasp quality and the risk measures as well as the sensitivity of the grasp quality to the pre-grasp position of the hand. Results show that the proposed risk metrics and the pre-grasp position correlate with the grasp quality, yet they are not sufficient to predict the outcome.

                     This keynote talk and paper intend to motivate research projects that investigate novel ways to model, analyze, and mitigate uncertainty arising in three different aspects of the cyber-physical systems. First, uncertainty about the physical environment can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes catastrophic, results as the system tries to adapt to unanticipated or poorly-understood environmental conditions. Second, uncertainty in the cyber environment can have lead to unexpected and adverse effects, including not only performance impacts (load, traffic, etc.) but also potential threats or overt attacks. Finally, uncertainty can exist with the components themselves and how they interact upon reconfiguration, including unexpected and unwanted feature interactions. Each of these sources of uncertainty can potentially be identified at different stages, respectively run time, design time, and requirements, but their mitigation might be done at the same or a different stage. Based on the related literature and our preliminary investigations, we argue that the following three overarching techniques are essential and warrant further research to provide enabling technologies to address uncertainty at all three stages: model-based development, assurance, and dynamic adaptation. Furthermore, we posit that in order to go beyond incremental improvements to current software engineering techniques, we need to leverage, extend, and integrate techniques from other disciplines.                </td>

                Trajectory generation is at the heart of an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Given a navigation context, the UAV has to conceive a trajectory that fulfills its mission goal while avoiding collisions with obstacles and surrounding traffic. This intended trajectory is an idealization of the various actual physical trajectories that the UAV may perform during flight. The validation of actual physical trajectories with respect to their intended counterparts is challenging due to the interaction over time of several uncontrolled factors such as the environmental conditions, measurement errors and the cyber-physical components of the UAV. For this reason, the most common validation technique for trajectory generators is flight simulation, which is not exhaustive and thus cannot prove the actual absence of collisions.
    
                This paper presents a preliminary formal framework to reason about the safety of UAV trajectories with respect to static-obstacle collision avoidance taking account of the uncertainties derived from uncontrolled factors. The proposed framework was formally verified in a mechanical theorem prover. Its application as an oracle for black-box testing validation of trajectory generators is also proposed. Such testing strategy would allow the safety evaluation of trajectories while removing the need for simulation procedures, thus reducing the cost of the validation process.

A new characteristic in Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems is that the applications of advanced intelligent machines which have communication, self-optimization and self-training behaviors. Based on this new change, this study investigates a flow-shop scheduling problem under the consideration of multiple objectives, time-dependent processing time and uncertainty. A mixed integer programming model is formulated for this problem, and a fireworks algorithm is developed where some special strategies are designed, e.g., explosion sparks procedure and selection solution procedure. Simulation experiments on a set of test problems are carried out, and the experimental results demonstrate that the model and proposed algorithm can achieve a satisfactory performance by comparing with three state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms.

							This paper develops a sampled-data (SD) controller for uncertain multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, possibly with non-minimum phase zeros, using the L1 adaptive control architecture. The proposed controller compensates for disturbances and uncertainties within the bandwidth of a low-pass filter. Sufficient conditions for robust stability are obtained for the closed-loop system with SD controller, where the input/output signals are held constant over a sampling period. It is shown that the hybrid closed-loop system can recover the performance of a continuous-time reference system as the sampling time of the SD controller tends to zero. Simulation examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings.

							Cyber-physical systems are often hybrid consisting of both discrete and continuous subsystems. The continuous dynamics in cyber-physical systems could be noisy and the environment in which these stochastic hybrid systems operate can also be uncertain. We focus on multimodal hybrid systems in which the switching from one mode to another is determined by a schedule and the optimal finite horizon control problem is to discover the switching schedule as well as the control inputs to be applied in each mode such that some cost metric is minimized over the given horizon. We consider discrete-time control in this paper. We present a two step approach to solve this problem with respect to convex cost objectives and probabilistic safety properties. Our approach uses a combination of sample average approximation and convex programming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on case studies from temperature-control in buildings and motion planning.

							Autonomous vehicles have found wide-ranging adoption in aerospace, terrestrial as well as marine use. These systems often operate in uncertain environments and in the presence of noisy sensors, and use machine learning and statistical sensor fusion algorithms to form an internal model of the world that is inherently probabilistic. Autonomous vehicles need to operate using this uncertain world-model, and hence, their correctness cannot be deterministically specified. Even once probabilistic correctness is specified, proving that an autonomous vehicle will operate correctly is a challenging problem. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a correct-by-synthesis approach to autonomous vehicle control. We propose a probabilistic extension of temporal logic, named Chance Constrained Temporal Logic (C2TL), that can be used to specify correctness requirements in presence of uncertainty. C2TL extends temporal logic by including chance constraints as predicates in the formula which allows modeling of perception uncertainty while retaining its ease of reasoning. We present a novel automated synthesis technique that compiles C2TL specification into mixed integer constraints, and uses second-order (quadratic) cone programming to synthesize optimal control of autonomous vehicles subject to the C2TL specification. We also present a risk distribution approach that enables synthesis of plans with lower cost without increasing the overall risk. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a diverse set of illustrative examples.

						When creating the Internet of Things and Smart Machines, the RULES ENGINE pattern is developed. The tasks that Rules Engine solves in real time are characterized by large amounts of data from various sensors. To account for uncertainty, a new model of Smart Rules Engine is proposed with a two-step inference engine, including an engine of abstraction from data. A model based on quantitative, definitive and generalization type of abstraction is considered. It is shown that the proposed model solves the problem of the bridge between natural language, as a carrier of the concept's meaning, and data from sensors, as carriers of the perception. A model for presenting a prototype is given in which incomplete knowledge, expert's uncertainty in the definition of the concept and aging of data are taken into account. The prototype and data model representation and the abstraction engine are built based on fuzzy L-R numbers and arithmetic operations on them. The preliminary step of abstraction from the data, besides taking into account the uncertainty of a different nature, significantly reduces the dimension of the fuzzy inference space. A comparison of the two-step fuzzy inference engine with the traditional inference engine Fuzzy Logic System Type-1 is given using the example of a wheeled robot making the decision to safely cross an unregulated crossroad.

						In recent years, expectations for large-scale wireless sensor networks have been rapidly increased due to miniaturization, cost reduction, reduction in power consumption of wireless sensor devices, and the emergence of wireless sensor network applications such as IoT (Internet Of Things). However, in addition to the uncertainty inherent in wireless sensor networks, due to the uncertainty caused by the expansion of wireless sensor networks, it is not easy to realize a highly efficient and reliable large-scale wireless sensor network. The uncertainty of wireless sensor networks is classified into three types: the uncertainty of nodes such as sensor nodes and sink nodes, the uncertainty of wireless communication links among nodes, and the uncertainty of traffic transferred over the wireless sensor network. In this paper, as a wireless communication standard, we focus on IEEE 802.15.4, which is designed for short-range wireless networks called PANs (Personal Area Networks), and analyze large-scale wireless sensor networks using fluid approximation. Specifically, IEEE 802.15.4 large-scale wireless sensor networks are analyzed by extending the modeling approach for generic CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) wireless networks. Moreover, our analysis makes it possible to probabilistically model temporal fluctuation of wireless communication ranges of nodes as network uncertainty. As a result, our analysis clarifies the effect of link uncertainty on the average message delivery delay in wireless sensor networks.

               	   	Internet of Vehicles (IoV, shortly) is a typical system of Internet of Things. Spatio-Temporal event stream is one of basic features of IoV. These event streams often are uncertain due to the limit of the monitoring device and the high speed of vehicles. Developing an event processing language to process these spatio-temporal event streams with uncertainty is a challenge issue. The goal of this paper is to develop a Probabilistic Event Processing Language, called as Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Event Processing language (PSTEP, shortly), dealing with this challenge issue. In PSTEP, we use the Possible World Model to express uncertain spatio-temporal events of IoV and assign a spatio-temporal event with a probability which is the threshold value for processing the existence of an event. We establish its syntax and operational semantics. Finally, a case study is given to show the effectiveness of the PSTEP language.

               	   	This paper systematically deals with robust consensus of uncertain linear multi-agent systems via dynamic output-feedback protocols. Agents are assumed to have identical nominal linear time-invariant dynamics but are subject to heterogeneous additive stable perturbations. Dynamic output-feedback protocols with or without controller state information exchange between neighboring controllers are studied in a unified framework. Two methods are proposed for protocol design, which need to solve an algebraic Riccati equation and some scalar/matrix inequalities. The first method characterizes some key parameters by scalar inequalities related to the nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian, which requires the diagonalizability of the Laplacian, while the second method characterizes the parameters by linear matrix inequalities, which circumvents the requirement of the diagonalizability of the Laplacian. Compared with existing results, the proposed approach can simultaneously cope with heterogeneous uncertainties and directed communication graphs. Numerical results verify the advantages of the proposed design methods.

Probabilistic optimal power flow (OPF) analysis is required to accomplish the electrical and economic operational goals. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to accelerate the computation of probabilistic OPF for large-scale smart grids through network reduction (NR). Cumulant-based method and Gram-Charlier expansion theory are used to efficiently obtain the statistics of system states. We develop a more accurate linear mapping method to compute the unknown cumulants. Our method speeds up the computation by up to 4.57X and can improve around 30% accuracy when Hessian matrix is ill-conditioned compared to the previous approach.

                               A critical issue in the Web of Things (WoT) is the need to process and analyze the interactions of Web-interconnected real-world objects. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a powerful technology for analyzing streams of information about real-time distributed events, coming from different sources, and for extracting conclusions from them. However, in many situations these events are not free from uncertainty, due to either unreliable data sources and networks, measurement uncertainty, or to the inability to determine whether an event has actually happened or not. This short research paper discusses how CEP systems can incorporate different kinds of uncertainty, both in the events and in the rules. A case study is used to validate the proposal, and we discuss the benefits and limitations of this CEP extension.

               	   			Designing secure cyber-physical systems (CPS) is a particularly difficult task since security vulnerabilities stem not only from traditional cybersecurity concerns, but also physical ones. Many of the standard methods for CPS design make strong and unverified assumptions about the trustworthiness of physical devices, such as sensors. When these assumptions are violated, subtle inter-domain vulnerabilities are introduced into the system model. In this paper we use formal specification of analysis contracts to expose security assumptions and guarantees of analyses from reliability, control, and sensor security domains. We show that this specification allows us to determine where these assumptions are violated, opening the door to malicious attacks. We demonstrate how this approach can help discover and prevent vulnerabilities using a self-driving car example.

               	   			The utility of wearables is currently limited to lab experiments and controlled environments mainly because computational algorithms embedded in wearables fail to produce accurate measurements in uncontrolled, dynamically changing, and potentially harsh environments. With the exponentially growing adoption of these systems in human-centered Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, development of resource-efficient solutions to enhance the accuracy of this systems remains a considerable research challenge. In this paper, we introduce an energy-efficient framework for uncertainty management of networked wearables. The core components of our framework are anomaly screening units for detecting anomalies that require handling, thus resulting in one order of magnitude less energy consumption compared to the conventional frameworks. Furthermore, our screening approach achieves 98.3% accuracy in detecting anomalies based on real data collected with wearable motion sensors.

               	   			A cyber-physical system (CPS) comprises several connected, embedded systems and is additionally equipped with sensors and actuators. Thus, CPSs can communicate with their cyber environment and measure and interact with their physical environment. Due to the complexity of their operational environment, assumptions the manufacturer have made may not hold in operation. During an unforeseen environmental situation, a CPS may expose behavior that negatively impactsits reliability. This may arise due to insufficiently considered environmental conditions during the design of a CPS, or – even worse – it is impossible to anticipate such conditions. In the U-Test project, we are developing a configurable search-based testing framework that exploits information from functional testing and from declarative descriptions of uncertainties. Itaims at revealing unintended behavior in the presence of uncertainties. This framework enables testing for different scenarios of uncertainty and thus, allows to achieve a certain coverage of those, and to find unknown uncertainty scenarios.

               	   			Self-adaptation provides a principled way to deal with software systems’ uncertainty during operation. Examples of such uncertainties are disturbances in the environment, variations in sensor readings, and changes in user requirements. As more systems with strict goals require self-adaptation, the need for formal guarantees in self-adaptive systems is becoming a high-priority concern. Designing self-adaptive software using principles from control theory has been identified as one of the approaches to provide guarantees. In general, self-adaptation covers a wide range of approaches to maintain system requirements under uncertainty, ranging from dynamic adaptation of system parameters to runtime architectural reconfiguration. Existing control-theoretic approaches have mainly focused on handling requirements in the form of setpoint values or as quantities to be optimized. Furthermore, existing research primarily focuses on handling uncertainty in the execution environment. This article presents SimCA*, which provides two contributions to the state-of-the-art in control-theoretic adaptation: (i) it supports requirements that keep a value above and below a required threshold, in addition to setpoint and optimization requirements; and (ii) it deals with uncertainty in system parameters, component interactions, system requirements, in addition to uncertainty in the environment. SimCA* provides guarantees for the three types of requirements of the system that is subject to different types of uncertainties. We evaluate SimCA* for two systems with strict requirements from different domains: an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle system used for oceanic surveillance and an Internet of Things application for monitoring a geographical area. The test results confirm that SimCA* can satisfy the three types of requirements in the presence of different types of uncertainty.

                            It is important that a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with uncertainty in its behavior caused by its unpredictable operating environment, to ensure its reliable operation. One method to ensure that the CPS will handle such uncertainty during its operation is by testing the CPS with model-based testing (MBT) techniques. However, existing MBT techniques do not explicitly capture uncertainty in test ready models, i.e., capturing the uncertain expected behavior of a CPS in the presence of environment uncertainty. To fill this gap, we present an Uncertainty-Wise test-modeling framework, named as UncerTum, to create test ready models to support MBT of CPSs facing uncertainty. UncerTum relies on the definition of a UML profile [the UML Uncertainty Profile (UUP)] and a set of UML Model Libraries extending the UML profile for Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems (MARTE). UncerTum also benefits from the UML Testing Profile V.2 to support standard-based MBT. UncerTum was evaluated with two industrial CPS case studies, one real-world case study, and one open-source CPS case study from the following four perspectives: (1) Completeness and Coverage of the profiles and Model Libraries in terms of concepts defined in their underlying uncertainty conceptual model for CPSs, i.e., U-Model and MARTE, (2) Effort required to model uncertainty with UncerTum, and (3) Correctness of the developed test ready models, which was assessed via model execution. Based on the evaluation, we can conclude that we were successful in modeling all the uncertainties identified in the four case studies, which gives us an indication that UncerTum is sufficiently complete. In terms of modeling effort, we concluded that on average UncerTum requires 18.5% more time to apply stereotypes from UUP on test ready models.

                            Uncertainty is intrinsic in most technical systems, including Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, handling uncertainty in a graceful manner during the real operation of CPS is critical. Since designing, developing, and testing modern and highly sophisticated CPS is an expanding field, a step towards dealing with uncertainty is to identify, define, and classify uncertainties at various levels of CPS. This will help develop a systematic and comprehensive understanding of uncertainty. To that end, we propose a conceptual model for uncertainty specifically designed for CPS. Since the study of uncertainty in CPS development and testing is still irrelatively unexplored, this conceptual model was derived in a large part by reviewing existing work on uncertainty in other fields, including philosophy, physics, statistics, and healthcare. The conceptual model is mapped to the three logical levels of CPS: Application, Infrastructure, and Integration. It is captured using UML class diagrams, including relevant OCL constraints. To validate the conceptual model, we identified, classified, and specified uncertainties in two distinct industrial case studies.

               	   	In the cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) environments, quantifying uncertainty is an important element input to keep the acceptable level of reliability in various configurations. In this paper, we aim to address the pricing model of delivering data over the cloud while taking into consideration the dynamic uncertainty factors such as network topology, transmission/reception energy, nodal charge and power, and computation capacity. These uncertainty factors are mapped to different nodes with varying capabilities to be processed using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms. Accordingly, we aim to find a way to calculate and predict the price per big data service over the cloud using AI and deep learning. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework to address big data delivery issues in cloud-based IoT environments by considering uncertainty factors. We compare the performance of the framework using two AI-based techniques called Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) in both centralized and distributed versions. The use of AI techniques can be applied in multilevel to provide a kind of deep learning to further improve the performance of the system under study. The results reveal that the distributed algorithm outperforms the centralized one. In addition, the results show that the GA has lower running time compared to the SAA in all the test cases such as 68% of improvement in the centralized version, and 66% of improvement in the distributed version in case when the size of uncertainty array is 256. Moreover, when the size of uncertainty array increases, the results show 60% speed up in the distributed GA compared to its centralized version. The improvements achieved would help the service providers to actually improve their profit using the proposed framework.

               	   	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are composed of computing devices interacting with physical systems. Model-based design is a powerful methodology in CPS design in the implementation of control systems. For instance, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is typically implemented in CPS applications, e.g., in path tracking of autonomous vehicles. MPC deploys a model to estimate the behavior of the physical system at future time instants for a specific time horizon. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) are the most commonly used models to emulate the behavior of continuous-time (non-)linear dynamical systems. A complex physical model may comprise thousands of ODEs which pose scalability, performance and power consumption challenges. One approach to address these model complexity challenges are frameworks that automate the development of model-to-model transformation. In this paper, we introduce a model generation framework to transform ODE models of a physical system to Hybrid Harmonic Equivalent State (HES) Machine model equivalents. Moreover, tuning parameters are introduced to reconfigure the model and adjust its accuracy from coarse-grained time critical situations to fine-grained scenarios in which safety is paramount. Machine learning techniques are applied to adopt the model to run-time applications. We conduct experiments on a closed-loop MPC for path tracking using the vehicle dynamics model. We analyze the performance of the MPC when applying our Hybrid HES Machine model. The performance of our proposed model is compared with state-of-the-art ODE-based models, in terms of execution time and model accuracy. Our experimental results show a 32% reduction in MPC return time for 0.8% loss in model accuracy.

               	   	Conventionally, the exposure regarding knowledge of the inter vehicle link duration is a significant parameter in Vehicular Networks to estimate the delay during the failure of a specific link during the transmission. However, the mobility and dynamics of the nodes is considerably higher in a smart city than on highways and thus could emerge a complex random pattern for the investigation of the link duration, referring all sorts of uncertain conditions. There are existing link duration estimation models, which perform linear operations under linear relationships without imprecise conditions. Anticipating, the requirement to tackle the uncertain conditions in Vehicular Networks, this paper presents a hybrid neural network-driven mobility prediction model. The proposed hybrid neural network comprises a Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann machine (FCBM), which allows the random patterns of several vehicles in a single time stamp to be learned. The several dynamic parameters, which may make the contexts of Vehicular Networks uncertain, could be vehicle speed at the moment of prediction, the number of leading vehicles, the average speed of the leading vehicle, the distance to the subsequent intersection of traffic roadways and the number of lanes in a road segment. In this paper, a novel method of hybrid intelligence is initiated to tackle such uncertainty. Here, the Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine (FCBM) is a stochastic graph model that can learn joint probability distribution over its visible units (say n) and hidden feature units (say m). It is evident that there must be a prime driving parameter of the holistic network, which will monitor the interconnection of weights and biases of the Vehicular Network for all these features. The highlight of this paper is that the prime driving parameter to control the learning process should be a fuzzy number, as fuzzy logic is used to represent the vague and uncertain parameters. Therefore, if uncertainty exists due to the random patterns caused by vehicle mobility, the proposed Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine could remove the noise from the data representation. Thus, the proposed model will be able to predict robustly the mobility in VANET, referring any instance of link failure under Vehicular Network paradigm.

                            Uncertainty is intrinsic in most technical systems, including Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, handling uncertainty in a graceful manner during the real operation of CPS is critical. Since designing, developing, and testing modern and highly sophisticated CPS is an expanding field, a step towards dealing with uncertainty is to identify, define, and classify uncertainties at various levels of CPS. This will help develop a systematic and comprehensive understanding of uncertainty. To that end, we propose a conceptual model for uncertainty specifically designed for CPS. Since the study of uncertainty in CPS development and testing is still irrelatively unexplored, this conceptual model was derived in a large part by reviewing existing work on uncertainty in other fields, including philosophy, physics, statistics, and healthcare. The conceptual model is mapped to the three logical levels of CPS: Application, Infrastructure, and Integration. It is captured using UML class diagrams, including relevant OCL constraints. To validate the conceptual model, we identified, classified, and specified uncertainties in two distinct industrial case studies.

               	   	  Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been deployed to monitor network activity and to protect systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices from attacks (or intrusions). The problem with these systems is that they generate a huge amount of inappropriate false alarms whenever abnormal activities are detected and they are not too flexible for a complex environment. The high-level rate of the generated false alarms reduces the performance of IDS against cyber-attacks and makes the tasks of the security analyst particularly difficult and the management of intrusion detection process computationally expensive. We study here one of the challenging aspects of computer and network security and we propose to build a detection model for both known and unknown intrusions (or anomaly detection) via a novel nonparametric Bayesian model. The design of our framework can be extended easily to be adequate for IoT technology and notably for intelligent smart city web-based applications. In our method, we learn the patterns of the activities (both normal and anomalous) through a Bayesian-based MCMC inference for infinite bounded generalized Gaussian mixture models. Contrary to classic clustering methods, our approach does not need to specify the number of clusters, takes into consideration the uncertainty via the introduction of prior knowledge for the parameters of the model, and permits to solve problems related to over- and under-fitting. In order to get better clustering performance, feature weights, model's parameters, and the number of clusters are estimated simultaneously and automatically. The developed approach was evaluated using popular data sets. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in detecting various attacks.

                           Neural State Classification (NSC) [19] is a scalable method for the analysis of hybrid
                           systems, which consists in learning a neural network-based classifier able to detect whether
                           or not an unsafe state can be reached from a certain configuration of a hybrid system. NSC
                           has very high accuracy, yet it is prone to prediction errors that can affect system safety.
                           To overcome this limitation, we present a method, based on the theory of conformal
                           prediction, that complements NSC predictions with statistically sound estimates of prediction
                           uncertainty. This results in a principled criterion to reject potentially erroneous
                           predictions a priori, i.e., without knowing the true reachability values. Our approach is
                           highly efficient (with runtimes in the order of milliseconds) and effective, managing in our
                           experiments to successfully reject almost all the wrong NSC predictions.

                           The problem of building statistical models of cyber-physical systems using operational data

                           performance of systems. The accurate modeling of fuelflow rate is an essential aspect of
                           analyzing aircraft engine performance. In this paper, operational data from Flight Data
                           Recordersare used to model the fuel flow rate. The independent variablesare restricted to
                           those which are obtainable from trajectory data.Treating the engine as a statistical system,
                           an algorithm based onGaussian Process Regression (GPR) is developed to estimate thefuel flow

            Localization underwater has been known to be challenging due to the limited accessibility of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to obtain absolute positions. This becomes more severe in the under-ice environment since the ocean surface is covered with ice, making it more difficult to access GPS or to deploy localization infrastructure. In this paper, a novel solution that minimizes localization uncertainty and communication overhead of under-ice Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is proposed. Existing underwater localization solutions generally rely on reference nodes at ocean surface or on localization infrastructure to calculate positions, and they are not able to estimate the localization uncertainty, which may lead to the increase of localization error. In contrast, using the notion of external uncertainty (i.e., the position uncertainty as seen by others), our solution can characterize an AUV’s position with a probability model. This model is further used to estimate the uncertainty associated with our proposed localization techniques. Based on this uncertainty estimate, we further propose algorithms to minimize localization uncertainty and communication overhead. Our solution is emulated and compared against existing solutions, showing improved performance.                </td>

                     Recently there has been increasing engineering activity in the deployment of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Different types of AUVs are being used for applications ranging from ocean exploration to coastal tactical surveillance. These AUVs generally follow a predictable trajectory specified by the mission requirements. Inaccuracies in models for deriving position estimates and the drift caused by ocean currents, however, lead to uncertainty when estimating an AUV’s position. In this article, two forms of position uncertainty – internal and external – are studied, which are the position uncertainty associated with a particular AUV as seen by itself and that as seen by others, respectively. Then, a statistical model to estimate the internal uncertainty for a general AUV is proposed. Based on this model, a novel mathematical framework using Unscented Kalman Filtering is developed to estimate the external uncertainty. Finally, the benefits of this framework for several location-sensitive applications are shown via emulations.                </td>

                            This paper deals with the problem of optimal bidding in a day-ahead market of electricity for a power producer having joint operation of wind with photovoltaic power systems and storage of energy. Uncertainty, not only on electricity market prices, but also on wind and photovoltaic powers, has to be faced in order to achieve optimal bidding. The problem is viewed as a sort of a two-stage stochastic optimization problem formulated by mix-integer linear programming. A case study with data from the Iberian Peninsula is presented and a comparison between joint and disjoint operations is discussed, allowing concluding that the joint operation attenuates the economic impact of disjoint operation volatility.

							Medical cyber-physical systems, such as the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), require evaluation of safety and efficacy in the context of a patient population in a clinical trial. Advances in computer modeling and simulation allow for generation of a simulated cohort or virtual cohort which mimics a patient population and can be used as a source of prior information. A major obstacle to acceptance of simulation results as a source of prior information is the lack of a framework for explicitly modeling sources of uncertainty in simulation results and quantifying the effect on trial outcomes.In this work, we formulate the Computer-Aided Clinical Trial (CACT) within a Bayesian statistical framework allowing explicit modeling of assumptions and utilization of simulation results at all stages of a clinical trial. To quantify the robustness of the CACT outcome with respect to a simulation assumption, we define δ-robustness as the minimum perturbation of the base prior distribution resulting in a change of the CACT outcome and provide a method to estimate the δ-robustness.We demonstrate the utility of the framework and how the results of δ-robustness evaluation can be utilized at various stages of a clinical trial through an application to the Rhythm ID Goes Head-to-head Trial (RIGHT), which was a comparative evaluation of the safety and efficacy of specific software algorithms across different implantable cardiac devices. Finally, we introduce a hardware interface that allows for direct interaction with the physical device in order to validate and confirm the results of a CACT for implantable cardiac devices.

                            Uncertainty is intrinsic in most technical systems, including Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, handling uncertainty in a graceful manner during the real operation of CPS is critical. Since designing, developing, and testing modern and highly sophisticated CPS is an expanding field, a step towards dealing with uncertainty is to identify, define, and classify uncertainties at various levels of CPS. This will help develop a systematic and comprehensive understanding of uncertainty. To that end, we propose a conceptual model for uncertainty specifically designed for CPS. Since the study of uncertainty in CPS development and testing is still irrelatively unexplored, this conceptual model was derived in a large part by reviewing existing work on uncertainty in other fields, including philosophy, physics, statistics, and healthcare. The conceptual model is mapped to the three logical levels of CPS: Application, Infrastructure, and Integration. It is captured using UML class diagrams, including relevant OCL constraints. To validate the conceptual model, we identified, classified, and specified uncertainties in two distinct industrial case studies.

We consider two extensions of the notion of weighted Kripke structures, namely (i) parametric weighted Kripke structures, having transitions weights modelled as affine maps over a set of parameters and, (ii) weight-uncertain Kripke structures, having transition labelled by real-valued random variables as opposed to precise real valued weights.
										We address this problem by using extended parametric dependency graphs, a symbolic extension of dependency graphs by Liu and Smolka. Experiments performed with a prototype tool implementation show that our approach outperforms by orders of magnitude an adaptation of a state-of-the-art tool for WKSs.

               	   	A fundamental problem in the design of closed-loop Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is in accurately capturing the dynamics of the underlying physical system. To provide optimal control for such closed-loop systems, model-based controls require accurate physical plant models. It is hard to analytically establish (a) how data quality from sensors affects model accuracy, and consequently, (b) the effect of model accuracy on the operational cost of model-based controllers. We present the Model-IQ toolbox which, given a plant model and real input data, automatically evaluates the effect of this uncertainty propagation from sensor data to model accuracy to controller performance. We apply the Model-IQ uncertainty analysis for model-based controls in buildings to demonstrate the cost-benefit of adding temporary sensors to capture a building model. We show how sensor placement and density bias training data. For the real building considered, a bias of 1% degrades model accuracy by 20%. Model-IQ's automated process lowers the cost of sensor deployment, model training and evaluation of advanced controls for small and medium sized buildings. Such end-to-end analysis of uncertainty propagation has the potential to lower the cost for CPS with closed-loop model based control.

               	   			As Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical systems become more ubiquitous and an integral part of our daily lives, it is important that we are able to trust the data aggregate from such systems. However, the interpretation of trustworthiness is contextual and varies according to the risk tolerance attitude of the concerned application and varying levels of uncertainty associated with the evidence upon which trust models act. Hence, the data integrity scoring mechanisms should have provisions to adapt to varying risk attitudes and uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian inference model and a prospect theoretic framework for data integrity scoring that quantify the trustworthiness of data collected from IoT devices by a hub in the presence of an adversary manipulating data and an imperfect anomaly monitoring mechanism. The monitoring mechanism monitors the data being sent from each device and classifies the outcome as not compromised, compromised, and cannot be inferred. These outcomes are conceptualized as a multinomial hypothesis of a Bayesian inference model with three parameters which are then used for calculating a utility value on how reliable the aggregate data is. We use prospect theory inspired approach to quantify this data integrity score and evaluate trustworthiness of the aggregate data from the IoT framework. As decisions are based on how the data is fused, we propose two measuring models-one optimistic and another conservative. The proposed framework is validated using extensive simulation experiments. We show how data integrity scores vary under a variety of system factors like attack intensity and inaccurate detection.

                           In many IoT applications, sensor nodes are distributed over a region of interests and collect
                           data at a specified time interval. With the development of hardware, the monitoring tasks
                           become diversity. The specified acquisition strategy can not adaptively adjust the sampling
                           interval. Due to the measurement error and the uncertainty of the environment, equi-frequency
                           sampling technique may result in misunderstandings to the physical world. Based on Taylor
                           expansion and time series analysis, this paper presents a sensed data model. The model can be
                           considered as a unified approach, where linear regression or spline interpolation is a
                           special case of our model. A mathematical method for parameter estimation is proposed, which
                           can minimize the measurement error. And we prove the estimation is unbias. An adaptive data
                           acquisition algorithm is proposed. Performance evaluation on the real data set verifies that
                           the proposed algorithms have high performance in terms of accuracy and effectiveness.

                           Self-Adaptive systems are expected to adapt to unanticipated run-time events using imperfect
                           information about their environment. This entails handling the effects of uncertainties in
                           decision-making, which are not always considered as a first-class concern. This paper
                           contributes a formal analysis technique that explicitly considers uncertainty in sensing when
                           reasoning about the best way to adapt, possibly executing uncertainty reduction operations to
                           improve system utility. We illustrate our approach on a Denial of Service (DoS) attack
                           scenario and present some preliminary results that show the benefits of uncertainty-aware
                           decision-making with respect to using an uncertainty-ignorant approach.

For these reasons, risk management in IoT could be improved by application of fuzzy data processing. The paper considers the main approaches to the construction of intelligent methods and algorithms of information security risk assessment and management for IoT. Mathematical models for security risk assessment in IoT are proposed and investigated. In relation to the concept of multi-agent network control, the Mamdani fuzzy inference procedures for risk assessment and management are developed. Procedures for fuzzy clustering, classification and ranking of security threats are outlined. The experimental results show high stability of the developed security risks management algorithms to uncertainties of input variables.

               	   		Medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) combine independent devices at runtime in order to render new patient monitoring/control functionalities, such as physiological closed loops for controlling drug infusion and optimization of alarms. MCPS and their relevant system contexts are highly variable, which detrimentally affects the application of established safety assurance methodologies. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on dynamic risk assessment and control for MCPS. During runtime, information regarding the safety properties of the constituent systems, relevant information about the patient’s characteristics, as well as other relevant context information is utilized to dynamically and continuously optimize the system performance while guaranteeing an acceptable level of safety. We evaluated our approach by means of a patient-controlled analgesia proof-of-concept simulation and sensitivity analysis.

               	   The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to connect billions of devices, that will interact with their physical environment through sensors or actuators. The measurements created from these sensors have varying levels of precision, leading to measurements that follow a distribution, whose variance presents an additional challenge for the employed security schemes. In this work we assume a smart attacker would attempt to mask his attack in the inherent uncertainty of the measurements, and attempt to manipulate the distribution of measurements as covertly as possible to affect the final meaningful value that the system would result in. We employ Game Theory to examine the best strategies to slowly corrupt the integrity of an IoT network, similar to ETSI's Low Throughput Networks (LTN). We examine the extent of the changes that can be made to the distribution without assuming a priori knowledge of it by the attacker, for different scenarios and compromisation patterns. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to examine the limits of the compromise that could be applied by a smart attacker on an IoT/LTN-type network without triggering outlier-alarms, and can be applied in the design of better targeted defensive measures.

                            Adaptive systems are expected to adapt to unanticipated run-time events using imperfect information about themselves, their environment, and goals. This entails handling the effects of uncertainties in decision-making, which are not always considered as a first-class concern. This paper contributes a formal analysis technique that explicitly considers uncertainty in sensing when reasoning about the best way to adapt, together with uncertainty reduction mechanisms to improve system utility. We illustrate our approach on a Denial of Service (DoS) attack scenario and present results that demonstrate the benefits of uncertainty-aware decision-making in comparison to using an uncertainty-ignorant approach, both in the presence and absence of uncertainty reduction mechanisms.

                           The problem of building statistical models of cyber-physical systems using operational data
                           is addressed in this paper, using thecase study of aircraft engines. These models serve as a
                           complementto physics-based models, which may not accurately reflect the operational
                           performance of systems. The accurate modeling of fuelflow rate is an essential aspect of
                           analyzing aircraft engine performance. In this paper, operational data from Flight Data
                           Recordersare used to model the fuel flow rate. The independent variablesare restricted to
                           those which are obtainable from trajectory data.Treating the engine as a statistical system,
                           an algorithm based onGaussian Process Regression (GPR) is developed to estimate thefuel flow
                           rate during the airborne phases of flight. The algorithmpropagates the uncertainty in the
                           estimates in order to determineprediction intervals. The proposed GPR models are evaluated
                           fortheir predictive performance on an independent set of flights. Theresulting estimates are
                           also compared with those given by the Baseof Aircraft Data (BADA) model, which is widely used
                           in aircraftperformance studies. The GPR models are shown to perform statistically
                           significantly better than the BADA model. The GPR modelsalso provide interval estimates for
                           the fuel flow rate which reflectthe variability seen in the data, presenting a promising
                           approachfor data-driven modeling of cyber-physical systems.

                              As software applications become highly interconnected in dynamically provisioned platforms, they form the so-called systems-of-systems. Therefore, a key issue that arises in such environments is whether specific requirements are violated, when these applications interact in new unforeseen ways as new resources or system components are dynamically provisioned. Such environments require the continuous use of frameworks for assessing compliance against specific mission critical system requirements. Such frameworks should be able to (a) handle large requirements models, (b) assess system compliance repeatedly and frequently using events from possibly high velocity and high frequency data streams, and (c) use models that can reflect the vagueness that inherently exists in big data event collection and in modeling dependencies between components of complex and dynamically re-configured systems. In this paper, we introduce a framework for run time reasoning over medium and large-scale fuzzy goal models, and we propose a process which allows for the parallel evaluation of such models. The approach has been evaluated for time and space performance on large goal models, exhibiting that in a simulation environment, the parallel reasoning process offers significant performance improvement over a sequential one.                </td>

                    This paper considers a synthetic counter-measure, combining transmission scheduling and defensive deception, to defend against jamming attacks in remote state estimation. In the setup studied, an attacker sabotages packet transmissions from a sensor to a remote estimator by congesting the communication channel between them. In order to efficiently degrade the estimation accuracy, the intelligent attacker tailors its jamming strategy by reacting to the real-time information it collects. In response to the jamming attacks, the sensor with a long-term goal will select the transmission power level at each stage. In addition, by modifying the real-time information intentionally, the sensor creates asymmetric uncertainty to mislead the attacker and thus mitigate attacks. Considering the dynamic nature of the process, we model the strategic interaction between the sensor and the attacker by a general stochastic game with asymmetric information structure. To obtain stationary optimal strategies for each player, we convert this game into a belief-based dynamic game and analyze the existence of its optimal solution. For a tractable implementation, we present an algorithm that finds equilibrium strategies based on multi-agent reinforcement learning for symmetric-information stochastic games. Numerical examples illustrate properties of the proposed algorithm.

               	   	This article is a tutorial on how to achieve software evolution and adaptation in a dependable manner, by systematically applying formal modelling and verification. It shows how software can be designed upfront to tolerate different sources of uncertainty that cause continuous future changes. If possible changes can be predicted, and their occurrence can be detected, it is possible to design the software to be self-adaptable. Otherwise, continuous evolution has to be supported and continuous flow into operation has to be ensured. In cases where systems are designed to be continuously running, it is necessary to support safe continuous software deployment that guarantees correct operation in the presence of dynamic reconfigurations. The approaches we survey here have been mainly developed in the context of the SMScom project, funded by the European Commission –Programme IDEAS-ERC (http://erc-smscom.dei.polimi.it/.) – and lead by the author. It is argued that these approaches fit well the current agile methods for development and operations that are popularized as DevOps.

               	   			Self-adaptation provides a principled way to deal with software systems’ uncertainty during operation. Examples of such uncertainties are disturbances in the environment, variations in sensor readings, and changes in user requirements. As more systems with strict goals require self-adaptation, the need for formal guarantees in self-adaptive systems is becoming a high-priority concern. Designing self-adaptive software using principles from control theory has been identified as one of the approaches to provide guarantees. In general, self-adaptation covers a wide range of approaches to maintain system requirements under uncertainty, ranging from dynamic adaptation of system parameters to runtime architectural reconfiguration. Existing control-theoretic approaches have mainly focused on handling requirements in the form of setpoint values or as quantities to be optimized. Furthermore, existing research primarily focuses on handling uncertainty in the execution environment. This article presents SimCA*, which provides two contributions to the state-of-the-art in control-theoretic adaptation: (i) it supports requirements that keep a value above and below a required threshold, in addition to setpoint and optimization requirements; and (ii) it deals with uncertainty in system parameters, component interactions, system requirements, in addition to uncertainty in the environment. SimCA* provides guarantees for the three types of requirements of the system that is subject to different types of uncertainties. We evaluate SimCA* for two systems with strict requirements from different domains: an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle system used for oceanic surveillance and an Internet of Things application for monitoring a geographical area. The test results confirm that SimCA* can satisfy the three types of requirements in the presence of different types of uncertainty.

               	   	We study the problem of checking weighted CTL properties for weighted Kripke structures in presence of imprecise weights. We consider two extensions of the notion of weighted Kripke structures, namely (i) parametric weighted Kripke structures, having transitions weights modelled as affine maps over a set of parameters and, (ii) weight-uncertain Kripke structures, having transition labelled by real-valued random variables as opposed to precise real valued weights.
										We address this problem by using extended parametric dependency graphs, a symbolic extension of dependency graphs by Liu and Smolka. Experiments performed with a prototype tool implementation show that our approach outperforms by orders of magnitude an adaptation of a state-of-the-art tool for WKSs.

                              Control-system robustness verification with respect to implementation aspects lacks automated verification approaches for checking stability and performance of uncertain control systems, when considering finite word-length (FWL) effects. Here we describe and evaluate novel verification procedures for digital systems with uncertainties, based on software model checking and satisfiability modulo theories, named as DSVerifier v2.0, which is able to check robust stability of closed-loop control systems with respect to FWL effects. In particular, we describe our verification algorithms to check for limit-cycle oscillations (LCOs), output quantization error, and robust non-fragile stability on common closed-loop associations of digital control systems (i.e., series and feedback). DSVerifier v2.0 model checks new properties of closed-loop systems (e.g., LCO), including stability and output quantization error for uncertain plant models, and considers unknown parameters and FWL effects. Experimental results over a large set of benchmarks show that 35%, 34%, and 41% of success can be reached for stability, LCO, and output quantization error verification procedures, respectively, for a set of 396 closed-loop control system implementations and realizations.                </td>

                     Long-lived, non-stop cyber-physical systems (CPS) are subject to evolutionary changes that can undermine the guarantees of schedulability that were verified at the time of deployment. At the same time, knowledge gleamed from extended periods of execution can be exploited to reduce the uncertainties that were inevitably presented in the system models that are used to define the temporal behaviours of the control tasks. In this paper we utilise this knowledge and present an adaptation method that actively extends the period of control tasks at run-time based on historical measurements. This can lead to lower power consumption or to the accommodation of increased computation resource demands from other components of the CPS. The method relies on online monitoring and model-based prediction to degrade control performance while having a minimal and acceptable impact on ongoing operations. Cloud-based computing is used to facilitate decision making and offload the local computation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method through control-scheduling co-simulation.                </td>

                As a new intelligent manufacturing model, the Internet of Manufacturing Things (IOMT) based on the Internet of Things technology has a large amount of random, fuzzy, and uncertain information, which makes the optimization of manufacturing services face challenges. On the basis of fully considering the uncertain factors in the process of manufacturing service, a quality of service (QoS) optimization method based on mixed information axioms is proposed to solve the optimization problem of manufacturing service in the IOMT environment. The mixed uncertainty model is expounded with random variables to express the range of system and fuzzy variables to describe the design range. In order to select the best resource or sort, the fuzzy mathematics and the axiomatic theory of axiomatic design theory are combined to evaluate the coexistence of ambiguity and randomness of the QoS. Finally, the process of treatment and optimization in practical application by taking the example of a hydraulic pump product seeking service through the civil aircraft IOMT service platform is described. This example is given out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with the traditional information axiom method, and this method extends the application scope of traditional information axioms.

                The ever-growing complexity of software systems coupled with their stringent availability requirements are challenging the manual management of software after its deployment. This has motivated the development of self-adaptive software systems. Self-adaptation endows a software system with the ability to satisfy certain objectives by automatically modifying its behavior at runtime. While many promising approaches for the construction of self-adaptive software systems have been developed, the majority of them ignore the uncertainty underlying the adaptation. This has been one of the key inhibitors to widespread adoption of self-adaption techniques in risk-averse real-world applications. Uncertainty in this setting is a vaguely understood term. In this paper, we characterize the sources of uncertainty in self-adaptive software system, and demonstrate its impact on the system’s ability to satisfy its objectives. We then provide an alternative notion of optimality that explicitly incorporates the uncertainty underlying the knowledge (models) used for decision making. We discuss the state-of-the-art for dealing with uncertainty in this setting, and conclude with a set of challenges, which provide a road map for future research.

                The problem of service composition is of key importance in the Internet of Things paradigm. A composite Web Service can clearly determine how real life objects described as Web Services could interact with each other. This article proposes a non-functional parameters aggregation algorithm, used in composite service plan optimisation stage, taking into account the uncertainty of the nonfunctional parameters. Also, an optimisation algorithm, using the proposed aggregation method, is presented to show the complete solution for the problem. In this proposition, the algorithm focuses on composite service plan optimisation with uncertain parameters with the given uncertainty description on example of uncertainty parameter. However, the proposed algorithm can be generalized, so it can be used also with other uncertain parameters    </tr>

               	   	In this paper, the leaderless consensus control of a group of high-order strict feedback nonlinear systems with uncertainties under sensor and actuator attacks is considered. A fully distributed adaptive leaderless consensus control strategy is proposed to deal with the sensor and actuator attacks. Compared with existing results in which the model considered is simple, a strict-feedback nonlinear system is considered in this paper, which makes the problem more challenging. It is shown that all closed-loop signals are uniformly bounded and asymptotic output consensus is achieved in presence of sensor and actuator attacks. Simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.

               	   	Power cyber-physical systems (PCPSs) are becoming increasingly complex and diverse, benefitting from all aspects of societal issues. A PCPS is a next-generation system that is a tight conjunction of computation, communication, control, and power systems. The integration of Internet of Things and PCPS generates a novel energy system, the Internet of Energy, which is the future of the energy system. In the same way, the connection of bulk components and the extensive communications among them has brought many insecurities, uncertainties, and security challenges. Thus, a study of the analysis and synthesis of the reliability and security of PCPS is presented in this paper. By considering the unsafe uncertainties, models are formulated for a general cyber-attack, and a double-loop architecture for security defense is designed. According to this framework, security control scenarios are obtained from the character of each kind of cyber-attack. Finally, a separately excited dc motor with uncertainty is used as an example to demonstrate the problem.

               	   	Programming embedded and cyber-physical systems requires attention not only to functional behavior and correctness, but also to non-functional aspects and specifically timing and performance. A structured, compositional, model-based approach based on stepwise refinement and abstraction techniques can support the development process, increase its quality and reduce development time through automation of synthesis, analysis or verification. Toward this, we introduce a theory of timed actors whose notion of refinement is based on the principle of worst-case design that permeates the world of performance-critical systems. This is in contrast with the classical behavioral and functional refinements based on restricting sets of behaviors. Our refinement allows time-deterministic abstractions to be made of time-non-deterministic systems, improving efficiency and reducing complexity of formal analysis. We show how our theory relates to, and can be used to reconcile existing time and performance models and their established theories.

               	   	The cyber-physical systems of Industry 4.0 are expected to generate vast amount of in-process data and revolutionise the way data, knowledge and wisdom is captured and reused in manufacturing industries. The goal is to increase profits by dramatically reducing the occurrence of unexpected process results and waste. ISO9001:2015 defines risk as effect of uncertainty. In the 7Epsilon context, the risk is defined as effect of uncertainty on expected results. The paper proposes a novel algorithm to embed risk based thinking in quantifying uncertainty in manufacturing operations during the tolerance synthesis process. This method uses penalty functions to mathematically represent deviation from expected results and solves the tolerance synthesis problem by proposing a quantile regression tree approach. The latter involves non parametric estimation of conditional quantiles of a response variable from in-process data and allows process engineers to discover and visualise optimal ranges that are associated with quality improvements. In order to quantify uncertainty and predict process robustness, a probabilistic approach, based on the likelihood ratio test with bootstrapping, is proposed which uses smoothed probability estimation of conditional probabilities. The mathematical formulation presented in this paper will allow organisations to extend Six Sigma process improvement principles in the Industry 4.0 context and implement the 7 steps of 7Epsilon in order to satisfy the requirements of clauses 6.1 and 7.1.6 of the ISO9001:2015 and the aerospace AS9100:2016 quality standard.

                                Detecting the anomalies timely in the condition monitoring data, which are highly relevant to the potential system faults, has become a research focus in many domains. Among the various detection methods available, the prediction-based algorithms are popular without using prior knowledge and expert labels. Additionally, these methods can take the time-ordered specialty into account which is highly significant for time-series-based anomaly detection. However, the detected feedback is binary, especially, due to the influence of inaccurate confidence interval (CI), the false alarm phenomena occur frequently based on predicted models. Thus this paper proposes an Uncertainty Fusion method to realize anomaly detection. Firstly, in order to estimate the data uncertainty, the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is applied to perform the prediction with uncertainty presentation. Then, based on the GPR model, the improved k-fold cross-validation is combined to represent the model uncertainty. Moreover, the quantitative error index is designed to provide more detecting information for decision-making. Eventually, the effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by different simulated and open-source data sets, as well as the real application in mobile traffic data detecting. The quantitative results on simulated data experiments show the proposed method can largely eliminate the false alarms without sacrificing much detection rate compared with the basic GPR model. Especially, the experiments on periodic data sets with high Signal Noise Ratio have the better performance. And the mobile traffic data detecting proves the Uncertainty Fusion method can expand the basic GPR model to meet the real industrial requirements.

               	   			Distributed fault diagnosis has been proposed as an effective technique for monitoring large scale, nonlinear and uncertain systems. It is based on the decomposition of the large scale system into a number of interconnected subsystems, each one monitored by a dedicated Local Fault Detector (LFD). Neighboring LFDs, in order to successfully account for subsystems interconnection, are thus required to communicate with each other some of the measurements from their subsystems. Anyway, such communication may expose private information of a given subsystem, such as its local input. To avoid this problem, we propose here to use differential privacy to pre-process data before transmission.

               	   			Industry 4.0 is the fourth and current working paradigm leaning on data exchange, data analysis and Internet of things for complete automation and optimization of manufacturing technologies. This 4.0 paradigm enables the possibility for optimal autonomous decision making and full autonomous operation of the facility. Since all manufacturing processes are inherently in-deterministic, optimal decision making will only work when provided with realistic uncertainty models. The authors have observed that the typical used prediction models are not accurate as they do not represent the in-deterministic nature of the processes in a realistic manner. The objective of this paper is to use the IoT- based logged data to design more relevant uncertainty models to optimize the industry 4.0 framework. For this purpose, p-box models are used to represent production variation as function of unknown in-deterministic parameters. Furthermore, by using regression learning on the database, we show that the uncertainty can be decreased. It is shown that classic stochastic models are not able to capture the full in-deterministic nature of the uncertainties. It makes therefore sense that autonomous decision making based on such stochastic models are unreliable and sub-optimal. Future research possibilities are discussed, based on the proposed uncertainty models, together with possible notions that will help in the development of reliable optimal decision making and more accurate adaptable Industry 4.0 framework.

               	   			Self-adaptation provides a principled way to deal with software systems’ uncertainty during operation. Examples of such uncertainties are disturbances in the environment, variations in sensor readings, and changes in user requirements. As more systems with strict goals require self-adaptation, the need for formal guarantees in self-adaptive systems is becoming a high-priority concern. Designing self-adaptive software using principles from control theory has been identified as one of the approaches to provide guarantees. In general, self-adaptation covers a wide range of approaches to maintain system requirements under uncertainty, ranging from dynamic adaptation of system parameters to runtime architectural reconfiguration. Existing control-theoretic approaches have mainly focused on handling requirements in the form of setpoint values or as quantities to be optimized. Furthermore, existing research primarily focuses on handling uncertainty in the execution environment. This article presents SimCA*, which provides two contributions to the state-of-the-art in control-theoretic adaptation: (i) it supports requirements that keep a value above and below a required threshold, in addition to setpoint and optimization requirements; and (ii) it deals with uncertainty in system parameters, component interactions, system requirements, in addition to uncertainty in the environment. SimCA* provides guarantees for the three types of requirements of the system that is subject to different types of uncertainties. We evaluate SimCA* for two systems with strict requirements from different domains: an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle system used for oceanic surveillance and an Internet of Things application for monitoring a geographical area. The test results confirm that SimCA* can satisfy the three types of requirements in the presence of different types of uncertainty.

                                Process algebra is one of the best suitable formal methods to model smart systems based on IoT, especially Smart Factory. However, because of some uncertainty, it is necessary to model predictability of the systems, based on the uncertainty. There have been several process algebras with probability, such as, PAROMA, PACSR, etc. However they are not well suitable for the smart systems, since they are based only on discrete model or exponential model. Consequently, only simple or targeted probability can be specified and analyzed. In order to handle such limitations, the paper presents a new formal method, called dTP-Calculus, extended from the existing dT-Calculus with discrete, normal, exponential, and uniform probability models. It provides all the possible probability features for Smart Factory with complex uncertainty. The specification of the modeling will be simulated statistically for Smart Factory, and further the simulation results will be analyzed for probabilistic properties of the systems. For implementation, a tool set for the calculus has been developed in the SAVE tool suite on the ADOxx Meta-Modeling Platform, including Specifier, Analyzer and Verifier. A Smart Factory example from Audi Cell Production System has been selected as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

                                Structured and unstructured uncertainties together with external disturbances may pose considerable challenges in realizing desired path-tacking and lane keeping of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a novel robust adaptive indirect control method based on an exponential-like-sliding-mode fuzzy type-2 neural network approach for enhanced path-tracking performance of road autonomous vehicles subject to parametric uncertainties related to vehicle nominal cornering stiffness, road-tire adhesion coefficient, inertial parameters, and forward speed. A hierarchical controller is designed and the stability of the closed-loop system is ensured along with deriving the adaptation laws by employing the Lyapunov stability theorem. The conventional reaching law related to the sliding mode degrades from the system stability and introduces an inherent chattering of the controller input. The convergence law for the sliding surface is adjusted based on a variable exponential sliding manifold to eliminate possible chattering in the buffeting switch zone near the origin. The proposed exponential-like sliding surface guarantees the swift and smooth global asymptotic convergence of the tracking error toward zero. Furthermore, an adaptive look-ahead path-tracking error term is introduced as an auxiliary error criterion to improve the vehicle path-tracking performance. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified through Matlab/Simulink–CarSim co-simulations and comparisons with selected reported control methods for two different road maneuvers. The results suggested substantially improved tracking performance by the proposed controller with robustness to withstand against the perturbed parameters and external disturbances.

                                One of the main purposes of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems is to provide information on the observed physical system and to notify when a certain observed complex event occurs in the system. The biggest challenge of the IoT systems is that the systems collect a massive amount of uncertain data from diverse IoT devices, where the devices are connected through the internet. In addition to that, some events are inferred from other events and uncertainty is propagated from parent events to the inferred events, which additionally contributes to overall system uncertainty. The observed complex events are a complex relationship of primitive events that are produced by IoT devices and collected in IoT system. There were a couple of attempts to quantify the system uncertainty by estimating the likelihood of the occurrence of events of interest while taking into account the uncertain data and uncertain parameters of the model of the physical system with rule-based complex event processing and/or Bayesian network. These methods were implemented as stand-alone software solutions that are unable to scale under heavy loads of incoming events. This paper proposes a micro-service based notification methodology that uses complex event recognition to handle the IoT system uncertainty.

                              In complex cyber-physical system operations, fault detection needs to be performed using limited state information for practicality and privacy concerns. While a well-designed observation can distinguish a faulty behavior from the normal behavior, it can also represent the action of hiding some of the state information or discrete mode switchings. In this paper, we present a method for constructing the observation maps in the form of metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas that can be formally proven to detect fault in a switched system, while preserving certain privacy conditions. We provide a theoretical framework of robust temporal logic inference for classification of switched system trajectories with spatial and temporal uncertainties. We simulate finitely many nominal trajectories and use the robust neighborhoods around the simulated trajectories to cover the infinite trajectories that constitute the system behavior. Thus, the designed observation maps with the inferred MTL formulas can detect fault and preserve privacy in a provably correct fashion. Our approach is implemented on the simulation model of a smart building testbed to detect thermal leakage in the room, while preserving multiple privacy conditions of the room occupancy.

                              This paper is concerned with the security control problem for a class of Markov jump systems subject to false data injection attack and incomplete transition rates. An on-line estimation strategy is provided for the time-variant and unknown cyber-attack modes. And then, an adaptive sliding mode controller is synthesized with different robust terms for different modes to guarantee the reachability of the specified sliding surface. Moreover, the sufficient conditions for the stability of the closed-loop systems are derived. Finally, it is shown from simulation results that the effect of both false data injection attack and incomplete TRs can be effectively attenuated by the present adaptive SMC method.                </td>

                     With the significant advancements in Information and Communications Technology (ICT), cloud based applications provide a novel approach to access applications which are not installed on the local computers. The integration of cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) indicated a bright future of the Internet. In this paper, a new architecture of cloud computing—Model as a Service (MaaS) is proposed. The feasibility of the proposed architecture is proved by implementing a groundwater model on cloud as a case study. The groundwater model is established using MODFLOW for the middle reach of the Heihe River Basin (HRB). The model is calibrated using in situ observation to ensure capability of simulating the groundwater process with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.70 m and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.64. The parameter uncertainties of the groundwater model are analyzed by sequential data assimilation algorithms (PF, Particle Filter; EnKF, Ensemble Kalman Filter) in a synthetic case. The results show that the parameter uncertainties are effectively reduced by incorporating observed information recursively. A comparison between PF and EnKF indicate that the results from PF are slightly better than those from EnKF. The integration shows a bright future for simulating the groundwater system in real-time. This study provides a flexible and effective approach for analyzing the uncertainties and time variant properties of the parameters and the proposed architecture of cloud computing provides a novel approach for the researchers and decision-makers to construct numerical models and follow-up researches.                </td>

                                In this paper, we present a new tool SReach, which solves probabilistic bounded reachability problems for two classes of models of stochastic hybrid systems. The first one is (nonlinear) hybrid automata with parametric uncertainty. The second one is probabilistic hybrid automata with additional randomness for both transition probabilities and variable resets. Standard approaches to reachability problems for linear hybrid systems require numerical solutions for large optimization problems, and become infeasible for systems involving both nonlinear dynamics over the reals and stochasticity. SReach encodes stochastic information by using a set of introduced random variables, and combines  \(\delta \) -complete decision procedures and statistical tests to solve  \(\delta \) -reachability problems in a sound manner. Compared to standard simulation-based methods, it supports non-deterministic branching, increases the coverage of simulation, and avoids the zero-crossing problem. We demonstrate SReach’s applicability by discussing three representative biological models and additional benchmarks for nonlinear hybrid systems with multiple probabilistic system parameters.

                              The Internet of Things is the natural continuity of the Ambient Intelligence where smart and ambient environments are built mainly by integrating a large number of interconnected smart objects (sensors, actuators, Smartphone, appliances, etc.) with heterogeneous capabilities abstracted as software services. These services can be composed on the fly and provided, all the time and everywhere, to assist users in their daily activities. A key issue in user-centered services composition is to intelligently and effectively discover and select the most relevant services that best match the users' requirements and closely meet the specified quality-of-service level. Monitoring seamlessly the provided services and enhancing their quality, is still a challenging issue due mainly to the dynamicity and uncertainty characterizing ambient environments. In this paper, we propose a new service-oriented, user-centered and event-aware Framework capable of performing services monitoring to handle automatically events that may occur in ambient environments. This monitoring is based on a dynamic services discovery and selection process to enhance self-adaptation to unpredicted changes, and ensure services continuity with best quality. The overall proposed Framework has been implemented and validated through a scenario dedicated to daily activity recognition in an Ambient-Assisted Living environment. In addition, the obtained performances from extensive tests show clearly the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed approach in the case of a large-scale environment.

                             Due to the ability to handle uncertain nonlinear hybrid systems, barrier certificate based method has been widely used in safety verification problem. In this paper, an efficient framework, combining sum of squares programming with interval analysis, is proposed to generate barrier certificates for uncertain nonlinear hybrid systems. It utilizes the feature of bounded uncertainties to get a deterministic hybrid system, whose barrier certificates can be efficiently computed using sum of squares programming. The computed barrier certificates are then chosen as candidate barrier certificates for the original uncertain hybrid system, and need to be checked the satisfaction of the associated barrier certificate conditions, via an interval analysis based method. As an application, our approach is used to verify safety properties of non-polynomial hybrid systems. Some experimental results are given to show the efficiency of our approach.

                             With the economic globalization and the intensification of market competition, competition between enterprises has developed into competition between supply chains. The influence and change of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology on the spatial structure and economic relationship of supply chain are all-round and profound, and then affect the allocation of resources and supply chain operation, which will lead to many new management problems. These problems will become a new field of enterprise supply chain management innovation. Based on the fuzzy theory, this paper uses six-point fuzzy numbers to represent the uncertainty in the supply chain and uses the possibility theory to establish the evaluation criteria for the overall performance of the supply chain. In order to satisfy the constraints of the final product order fulfillment rate and minimize the overall inventory cost of the supply chain, the model integrates and optimizes the manufacturing resource allocation strategy of the supply chain in the IoT. Finally, the effectiveness of the model is verified by simulation, which provides theoretical support for the decision-making of the supply chain enterprises in the IoT environment

               	   	A fundamental problem in the design of closed-loop Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is in accurately capturing the dynamics of the underlying physical system. To provide optimal control for such closed-loop systems, model-based controls require accurate physical plant models. It is hard to analytically establish (a) how data quality from sensors affects model accuracy, and consequently, (b) the effect of model accuracy on the operational cost of model-based controllers. We present the Model-IQ toolbox which, given a plant model and real input data, automatically evaluates the effect of this uncertainty propagation from sensor data to model accuracy to controller performance. We apply the Model-IQ uncertainty analysis for model-based controls in buildings to demonstrate the cost-benefit of adding temporary sensors to capture a building model. We show how sensor placement and density bias training data. For the real building considered, a bias of 1% degrades model accuracy by 20%. Model-IQ's automated process lowers the cost of sensor deployment, model training and evaluation of advanced controls for small and medium sized buildings. Such end-to-end analysis of uncertainty propagation has the potential to lower the cost for CPS with closed-loop model based control. We demonstrate this with real building data in the Department of Energy's HUB.

So, for a particular time period, it is very tough to find the appropriate data for its certainty. In this paper, all received sensor data are to be assumed as fuzzy numbers, and such assumption could be beneficial to improve the functionality of data availability and accessibility in service-oriented architecture (SOA) system. Whenever any service is requested for updated sensor data, it must be handled through well-defined architecture, and this is governed by enterprise service bus (ESB). This ESB extends the features for SOA as well as strengthen the service middleware architecture. Sensor data received through this ESB would need corrections and cleanliness which could be done through fuzzy theory and help in reducing the uncertainty in data.

               	   			As Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical systems become more ubiquitous and an integral part of our daily lives, it is important that we are able to trust the data aggregate from such systems. However, the interpretation of trustworthiness is contextual and varies according to the risk tolerance attitude of the concerned application and varying levels of uncertainty associated with the evidence upon which trust models act. Hence, the data integrity scoring mechanisms should have provisions to adapt to varying risk attitudes and uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian inference model and a prospect theoretic framework for data integrity scoring that quantify the trustworthiness of data collected from IoT devices by a hub in the presence of an adversary manipulating data and an imperfect anomaly monitoring mechanism. The monitoring mechanism monitors the data being sent from each device and classifies the outcome as not compromised, compromised, and cannot be inferred. These outcomes are conceptualized as a multinomial hypothesis of a Bayesian inference model with three parameters which are then used for calculating a utility value on how reliable the aggregate data is. We use prospect theory inspired approach to quantify this data integrity score and evaluate trustworthiness of the aggregate data from the IoT framework. As decisions are based on how the data is fused, we propose two measuring models-one optimistic and another conservative. The proposed framework is validated using extensive simulation experiments. We show how data integrity scores vary under a variety of system factors like attack intensity and inaccurate detection.

                           In many IoT applications, sensor nodes are distributed over a region of interests and collect
                           data at a specified time interval. With the development of hardware, the monitoring tasks
                           become diversity. The specified acquisition strategy can not adaptively adjust the sampling
                           interval. Due to the measurement error and the uncertainty of the environment, equi-frequency
                           sampling technique may result in misunderstandings to the physical world. Based on Taylor
                           expansion and time series analysis, this paper presents a sensed data model. The model can be
                           considered as a unified approach, where linear regression or spline interpolation is a
                           special case of our model. A mathematical method for parameter estimation is proposed, which
                           can minimize the measurement error. And we prove the estimation is unbias. An adaptive data
                           acquisition algorithm is proposed. Performance evaluation on the real data set verifies that
                           the proposed algorithms have high performance in terms of accuracy and effectiveness.

                           Self-Adaptive systems are expected to adapt to unanticipated run-time events using imperfect
                           information about their environment. This entails handling the effects of uncertainties in
                           decision-making, which are not always considered as a first-class concern. This paper
                           contributes a formal analysis technique that explicitly considers uncertainty in sensing when
                           reasoning about the best way to adapt, possibly executing uncertainty reduction operations to
                           improve system utility. We illustrate our approach on a Denial of Service (DoS) attack
                           scenario and present some preliminary results that show the benefits of uncertainty-aware
                           decision-making with respect to using an uncertainty-ignorant approach.

                              Predicting traffic flow is one of the fundamental needs to comfortable travel, but this task is challenging in vehicular cyber–physical systems because of ever-increasing uncertain traffic big data. Although deep-learning (DL) methods with outstanding performance recently have become popular, most existing DL models for traffic flow prediction are fully deterministic and shed no light on data uncertainty. In this study, a novel fuzzy deep-learning approach called FDCN is proposed for predicting citywide traffic flow. This approach is built on the fuzzy theory and the deep residual network model. Our key idea is to introduce the fuzzy representation into the DL model to lessen the impact of data uncertainty. A model of fuzzy deep convolutional network is established to improve traffic flow prediction while investigating the spatial and temporal correlation of traffic flow. We further propose pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that efficiently learn parameters of the FDCN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a fuzzy DL approach has been applied to represent traffic features for traffic flow prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach to traffic flow prediction has superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.                </td>

                Pervasive information consumers in open, loosely-coupled systems, such as in Internet of Things and crowd-sensing environment, will rely more and more often on streaming information from sensory sources with whom they have only ephemeral, transient relationships. In such settings, information uncertainties arise as the trustworthiness of the sources and their information become questionable. It is thus necessary to quantify the quality of inferences made with such information to aid more informed and effective decision making and action taking. One of the aspects of trust assessment systems is to provide for such quality metrics, however, these systems have been traditionally applied in static situations. In this paper, we introduce TAF, a trust assessment framework for streaming information that leverages the rich toolkit of subjective logic operators to estimate the quality of said inferences under information uncertainty. We present the system architecture, describe its components and provide some preliminary quality results for the framework.        </td>

                            Uncertainty is one of the most critical aspects that affect the quality of Big Data management and mining methods. Clustering uncertain data has traditionally focused on data coming from location- based services, sensor networks, or error-prone laboratory experiments. In this work we study for the first time the impact of clustering uncertain data on a novel context consisting in visiting styles in an art exhibition. We consider a dataset derived from the interaction of visitors of a museum with a complex Internet of Things (IoT) framework. We model this data as a set of uncertain objects, and cluster them by employing the well-established UK-medoids algorithm. Results show that clustering accuracy is positively impacted when data uncertainty is taken into account.

							The use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and devices is on a sharp rise with the help of infrastructures like 5G cellular networks. However, with this swift expansion come major challenges such as management of the vast data collected by these IoT devices. In the paper, we propose a method which takes advantage of fuzzy similarity to significantly simplify the big data analysis and management for human operators and machines. A use case in the area of smart buildings was utilized to illustrate its potential application. A comparison is made between the ideal situation and the data collected from an office room. The considered environmental factors in this research are temperature, humidity, and workplace lighting and then the collected data was utilized to make triangular fuzzy numbers and after that, we compare them with an efficient fuzzy similarity measure. In addition to data summarization and abstraction, this method also protects the main information from inaccuracy. The advantage of the fuzzy controlling system is its aptitude to deal with nonlinearities and uncertainties.

							With the emergence of the Internet of Things and smart devices, smart homes are becoming more and more popular. The main goal of this study is to implement an event driven system in a smart home and to extract meaningful information from the raw data collected by the deployed sensors using Complex Event Processing (CEP). These high-level events can then be used by multiple smart home applications in particular situation identification. However, in real life scenarios, low-level events are generally uncertain. In fact, an event may be outdated, inaccurate, imprecise or in contradiction with another one. This can lead to misinterpretation from CEP and the associated applications. To overcome these weaknesses, in this paper, we propose a Fuzzy Semantic Complex Event Processing (FSCEP) model which can represent and reason with events by including domain knowledge and integrating fuzzy logic. It handles multiple dimensions of uncertainty, namely freshness, accuracy, precision and contradiction. FSCEP has been implemented and compared with a well known CEP. The results show how some ambiguities are solved.

For these reasons, risk management in IoT could be improved by application of fuzzy data processing. The paper considers the main approaches to the construction of intelligent methods and algorithms of information security risk assessment and management for IoT. Mathematical models for security risk assessment in IoT are proposed and investigated. In relation to the concept of multi-agent network control, the Mamdani fuzzy inference procedures for risk assessment and management are developed. Procedures for fuzzy clustering, classification and ranking of security threats are outlined. The experimental results show high stability of the developed security risks management algorithms to uncertainties of input variables.

               	   		Medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) combine independent devices at runtime in order to render new patient monitoring/control functionalities, such as physiological closed loops for controlling drug infusion and optimization of alarms. MCPS and their relevant system contexts are highly variable, which detrimentally affects the application of established safety assurance methodologies. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on dynamic risk assessment and control for MCPS. During runtime, information regarding the safety properties of the constituent systems, relevant information about the patient’s characteristics, as well as other relevant context information is utilized to dynamically and continuously optimize the system performance while guaranteeing an acceptable level of safety. We evaluated our approach by means of a patient-controlled analgesia proof-of-concept simulation and sensitivity analysis.

These event streams often are uncertain due to the limit of the monitoring device and the high speed of vehicles. Developing an event processing language to process these spatio-temporal event streams with uncertainty is a challenge issue. The goal of this paper is to develop a Probabilistic Event Processing Language, called as Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Event Processing language (PSTEP, shortly), dealing with this challenge issue. In PSTEP, we use the Possible World Model to express uncertain spatio-temporal events of IoV and assign a spatio-temporal event with a probability which is the threshold value for processing the existence of an event. We establish its syntax and operational semantics. Finally, a case study is given to show the effectiveness of the PSTEP language.

               	   The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to connect billions of devices, that will interact with their physical environment through sensors or actuators. The measurements created from these sensors have varying levels of precision, leading to measurements that follow a distribution, whose variance presents an additional challenge for the employed security schemes. In this work we assume a smart attacker would attempt to mask his attack in the inherent uncertainty of the measurements, and attempt to manipulate the distribution of measurements as covertly as possible to affect the final meaningful value that the system would result in. We employ Game Theory to examine the best strategies to slowly corrupt the integrity of an IoT network, similar to ETSI's Low Throughput Networks (LTN). We examine the extent of the changes that can be made to the distribution without assuming a priori knowledge of it by the attacker, for different scenarios and compromisation patterns. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to examine the limits of the compromise that could be applied by a smart attacker on an IoT/LTN-type network without triggering outlier-alarms, and can be applied in the design of better targeted defensive measures.

                                This paper develops a model-based framework for the quantification and propagation of multiple uncertainty sources affecting the performance of a smart system. A smart system, in general, performs sensing, control and actuation for proper functioning of a physical subsystem (also referred to as a plant). With strong feedback coupling between several subsystems, the uncertainty in the quantities of interest (QoI) amplifies over time. The coupling in a generic smart system occurs at two levels: (1) coupling between individual subsystems (plant, cyber, actuation, sensors), and (2) coupling between nodes in a distributed computational subsystem. In this paper, a coupled smart system is decoupled and considered as a feed-forward system over time and modeled using a two-level Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), one at each level of coupling (between subsystems and between nodes). A DBN can aggregate uncertainty from multiple sources within a time step and across time steps. The DBN associated with a smart system can be learned using available system models, physics models and data. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for the design of a smart indoor heating system (identification of sensors and a wireless network) within cost constraints that enables room-by-room temperature control. We observe that sensor uncertainty has a higher impact on the performance of the heating system compared to the uncertainty in the wireless network.

                                Detecting the anomalies timely in the condition monitoring data, which are highly relevant to the potential system faults, has become a research focus in many domains. Among the various detection methods available, the prediction-based algorithms are popular without using prior knowledge and expert labels. Additionally, these methods can take the time-ordered specialty into account which is highly significant for time-series-based anomaly detection. However, the detected feedback is binary, especially, due to the influence of inaccurate confidence interval (CI), the false alarm phenomena occur frequently based on predicted models. Thus this paper proposes an Uncertainty Fusion method to realize anomaly detection. Firstly, in order to estimate the data uncertainty, the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is applied to perform the prediction with uncertainty presentation. Then, based on the GPR model, the improved k-fold cross-validation is combined to represent the model uncertainty. Moreover, the quantitative error index is designed to provide more detecting information for decision-making. Eventually, the effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by different simulated and open-source data sets, as well as the real application in mobile traffic data detecting. The quantitative results on simulated data experiments show the proposed method can largely eliminate the false alarms without sacrificing much detection rate compared with the basic GPR model. Especially, the experiments on periodic data sets with high Signal Noise Ratio have the better performance. And the mobile traffic data detecting proves the Uncertainty Fusion method can expand the basic GPR model to meet the real industrial requirements.

                                The enhancement in the number of sensors deployed to collect every single bit of information to develop intelligent applications is potentially growing in today's Internet of Things paradigm. The acquired data from sensors is to be inferred into meaningful information for decision making to address real world situations. Context information modeling and reasoning is one of the investigative research concern in the design and development of smart health care applications. As the accessed information is inherently imperfect, we propose a computational intelligence technique to analyze uncertainty associated with sensor data. In this paper, we propose Context Information, Observation and Belief (C-IOB) model from the perspective of in-hospital environment and the analysis is based on Bayesian network to deal with imprecise information. The proposed model provides a relevant service based on our research findings.

                                The popular use of wearable devices and mobile phones makes the effective capture of life-logging physical activity (PA) data in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment possible. The effective collection of measures of PA in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers and patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, life-logging PA information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this study, the authors project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as daily activity in physical space and present an ellipse-fitting model-based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging PA measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method remarkably improves the validity of PA measures in a healthcare platform.

                                The sharing of data and resources in Future Internet applications (Machine-to-Machine (M2M), Internet of Things (IoT), Web of People (Web2.0), Web of Data (Web3.0)) and the massive distribution of data sources introduces heterogeneity in the Quality of Information (QoI) produced. It is thus necessary to be able to evaluate the QoI at any time and to take it into account for further processing and analysis. In this paper, we present an extension of a semantic context broker which enables to handle the dual problems of trust amongst the data sources and uncertainty in the context data. This extension is based on incorporating one ontology for modeling uncertainty and one ontology for modeling trust, to an IoT ontology that the initial semantic context broker was already based upon. The resulting system has been implemented and tested successfully on real data.

                                Timeliness, accuracy and effectiveness of manufacturing information in manufacturing and business process management have become important factors of constraint to business growth. Single RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology with uncertainty will cause great difficulties for application systems. This paper mainly focuses on the process of manufacturing information, real-time information perception and processing problems. It achieves real-time manufacturing information acquisition and processing by combining RFID and sensor technology, which uses Complex Event Processing (CEP) mechanism to realize sensor and RFID data fusion. First of all, the event processing framework which is from the perspective of the integration of sensors and RFID is given. Then, real-time acquisition and intelligent information processing models were introduced, including primitive event handling and complex event processing method. Finally, the practicality of our method was verified through applying it to a mold manufacturing enterprise management field.

                                One of the main purposes of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems is to provide information on the observed physical system and to notify when a certain observed complex event occurs in the system. The biggest challenge of the IoT systems is that the systems collect a massive amount of uncertain data from diverse IoT devices, where the devices are connected through the internet. In addition to that, some events are inferred from other events and uncertainty is propagated from parent events to the inferred events, which additionally contributes to overall system uncertainty. The observed complex events are a complex relationship of primitive events that are produced by IoT devices and collected in IoT system. There were a couple of attempts to quantify the system uncertainty by estimating the likelihood of the occurrence of events of interest while taking into account the uncertain data and uncertain parameters of the model of the physical system with rule-based complex event processing and/or Bayesian network. These methods were implemented as stand-alone software solutions that are unable to scale under heavy loads of incoming events. This paper proposes a micro-service based notification methodology that uses complex event recognition to handle the IoT system uncertainty.

                               Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is widely used to track and trace objects in supply chain management. However, massive uncertain data produced by RFID readers are not suitable for directly use in RFID applications. Following our thorough analysis of key features of RFID objects, this paper proposes a new framework for effectively and efficiently processing uncertain RFID data, and supporting a variety of queries for tracking and tracing RFID objects. In particular, we propose an adaptive cleaning method by adjusting size of smoothing window according to various rates of uncertain data, employing different strategies to process uncertain readings, and distinguishing different types of uncertain data according to their appearing positions. We propose a comprehensive data model, which is suitable for a wide range of application scenarios. In addition, a path coding scheme is proposed to significantly compress massive data by aggregating the path sequences, the positions and the time intervals. Experimental evaluations show that our approach is effective and efficient in terms of the compression and traceability queries.

                             Recently, the popular use of wearable devices and mobile apps makes the effectively capture of lifelogging physical activity data in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment possible. The effective collection of measures of physical activity in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers to patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging physical activity information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing life-logging physical activity measurement devices, and identify regular and irregular uncertainties of these activity measures in an IoT environment. We then project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as Daily Activity in Physical Space (DAPS). Finally, we present an ellipse fitting model based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging physical activity measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method effectively improves the validity of physical activity measures in a healthcare platform.

                             Internet of Things (IoT) technology offers opportunities to monitor lifelogging data by a variety of assets, like wearable sensors, mobile apps, etc. But due to heterogeneity of connected devices and diverse human life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging personal data contains huge uncertainty and are hardly used for healthcare studies. Effective validation of lifelogging personal data for longitudinal health assessment is demanded. In this paper, lifelogging physical activity (LPA) is taken as a target to explore how to improve the validity of lifelogging data in an IoT enabled healthcare system. A rule-based adaptive LPA validation (LPAV) model, LPAV-IoT, is proposed for eliminating irregular uncertainties (IUs) and estimating data reliability in IoT healthcare environments. A methodology specifying four layers and three modules in LPAV-IoT is presented for analyzing key factors impacting validity of LPA. A series of validation rules are designed with uncertainty threshold parameters and reliability indicators and evaluated through experimental investigations. Following LPAV-IoT, a case study on a personalized healthcare platform myhealthavatar connecting three state-of-the-art wearable devices and mobile apps are carried out. The results reflect that the rules provided by LPAV-IoT enable efficiently filtering at least 75% of IU and adaptively indicating the reliability of LPA data on certain condition of IoT environments.

                            Adaptive systems are expected to adapt to unanticipated run-time events using imperfect information about themselves, their environment, and goals. This entails handling the effects of uncertainties in decision-making, which are not always considered as a first-class concern. This paper contributes a formal analysis technique that explicitly considers uncertainty in sensing when reasoning about the best way to adapt, together with uncertainty reduction mechanisms to improve system utility. We illustrate our approach on a Denial of Service (DoS) attack scenario and present results that demonstrate the benefits of uncertainty-aware decision-making in comparison to using an uncertainty-ignorant approach, both in the presence and absence of uncertainty reduction mechanisms.

               	   	Changing production systems and product requirements can trace their origin in volatile customer behaviour and evolving product requirements. This dynamic nature of customer requirements has been described as a constantly moving target, thus presenting a significant challenge for several aspects of product development. To deal with this constant and sometimes unpredictable product evolution, cyber physical production systems (CPPS) that employ condition monitoring, self-awareness and reconfigurability principles, have to be designed and implemented. This research contributes a CPPS design approach that proactively provides the required CPPS design knowledge. This approach aims to minimise or avoids future consequences and disruptions on the CPPS. This knowledge needs to be provided at the right time whilst not being intrusive to the production system designer’s cognitive activity. To effectively deal with the complexity of the cyber physical production system design activity with a manual method would lead to a time consuming, and complex support tool which is hard to implement, and difficult to use. The CPPS design approach has therefore been implemented in a prototype digital factory tool. This paper describes in detail the system requirements and system architecture for this tool. In order to establish the effectiveness of the proposed approach for designing cyber physical production systems, the prototype digital factory tool has been evaluated with a case study and a number of semi-structured interviews with both industrial and scientific stakeholders. The encouraging results obtained from this research evaluation have shown that such an approach for supporting the CPPS design activity makes stakeholders aware of their decision consequences and is useful in practice. This result can lead the way for the development and integration of such knowledge-based decision-making approaches within state-of-the-art digital factory and Computer Aided Engineering Design (CAED) tools.

							Cyber-physical systems are often hybrid consisting of both discrete and continuous subsystems. The continuous dynamics in cyber-physical systems could be noisy and the environment in which these stochastic hybrid systems operate can also be uncertain. We focus on multimodal hybrid systems in which the switching from one mode to another is determined by a schedule and the optimal finite horizon control problem is to discover the switching schedule as well as the control inputs to be applied in each mode such that some cost metric is minimized over the given horizon. We consider discrete-time control in this paper. We present a two step approach to solve this problem with respect to convex cost objectives and probabilistic safety properties. Our approach uses a combination of sample average approximation and convex programming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on case studies from temperature-control in buildings and motion planning.

						Program variables used in robotic and cyber-physical systems often have implicit physical units that cannot be determined from their variable types. Inferring an abstract physical unit type for variables and checking their physical unit type consistency is of particular importance for validating the correctness of such systems. For instance, a variable with the unit of ‘meter’ should not be assigned to another variable with the unit of ‘degree-per-second’. Existing solutions have various limitations such as requiring developers to annotate variables with physical units and only handling variables that are directly or transitively used in popular robotic libraries with known physical unit information. We observe that there are a lot of physical unit hints in these softwares such as variable names and specific forms of expressions. These hints have uncertainty as developers may not respect conventions. We propose to model them with probability distributions and conduct probabilistic inference. At the end, our technique produces a unit distribution for each variable. Unit inconsistencies can then be detected using the highly probable unit assignments. Experimental results on 30 programs show that our technique can infer units for 159.3% more variables compared to the state-of-the-art with more than 88.7% true positives, and inconsistencies detection on 90 programs shows that our technique reports 103.3% more inconsistencies with 85.3% true positives.

                                Acceptance testing validates that a system meets its requirements and determines whether it can be sufficiently trusted and put into operation. For cyber physical systems (CPS), acceptance testing is a hardware-in-the-loop process conducted in a (near-)operational environment. Acceptance testing of a CPS often necessitates that the test cases be prioritized, as there are usually too many scenarios to consider given time constraints. CPS acceptance testing is further complicated by the uncertainty in the environment and the impact of testing on hardware. We propose an automated test case prioritization approach for CPS acceptance testing, accounting for time budget constraints, uncertainty, and hardware damage risks. Our approach is based on multi-objective search, combined with a test case minimization algorithm that eliminates redundant operations from an ordered sequence of test cases. We evaluate our approach on a representative case study from the satellite domain. The results indicate that, compared to test cases that are prioritized manually by satellite engineers, our automated approach more than doubles the number of test cases that fit into a given time frame, while reducing to less than one third the number of operations that entail the risk of damage to key hardware components.

                               Device-to-device communication is widely used for mobile devices and Internet of Things. Authentication and key agreement are critical to build a secure channel between two devices. However, existing approaches often rely on a pre-built fingerprint database and suffer from low key generation rate. We present GeneWave, a fast device authentication and key agreement protocol for commodity mobile devices. GeneWave first achieves bidirectional initial authentication based on the physical response interval between two devices. To keep the accuracy of interval estimation, we eliminate time uncertainty on commodity devices through fast signal detection and redundancy time cancellation. Then, we derive the initial acoustic channel response for device authentication. We design a novel coding scheme for efficient key agreement while ensuring security. Therefore, two devices can authenticate each other and securely agree on a symmetric key. GeneWave requires neither special hardware nor pre-built fingerprint database, and thus it is easyto-use on commercial mobile devices. We implement GeneWave on mobile devices (i.e., Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P) and evaluate its performance through extensive experiments. Experimental results show that GeneWave efficiently accomplish secure key agreement on commodity smartphones with a key generation rate 10× faster than the state-of-the-art approach.

                              In complex cyber-physical system operations, fault detection needs to be performed using limited state information for practicality and privacy concerns. While a well-designed observation can distinguish a faulty behavior from the normal behavior, it can also represent the action of hiding some of the state information or discrete mode switchings. In this paper, we present a method for constructing the observation maps in the form of metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas that can be formally proven to detect fault in a switched system, while preserving certain privacy conditions. We provide a theoretical framework of robust temporal logic inference for classification of switched system trajectories with spatial and temporal uncertainties. We simulate finitely many nominal trajectories and use the robust neighborhoods around the simulated trajectories to cover the infinite trajectories that constitute the system behavior. Thus, the designed observation maps with the inferred MTL formulas can detect fault and preserve privacy in a provably correct fashion. Our approach is implemented on the simulation model of a smart building testbed to detect thermal leakage in the room, while preserving multiple privacy conditions of the room occupancy.

               	   <td colspan="7"><b>Abstract</b>: 
               	   	As compared with classical software/system testing, uncertainty-wise testing explicitly addresses known uncertainty about the behavior of a System Under Test (SUT), its operating environment, and interactions between the SUT and its operational environment, across all testing phases, including test design, test generation, test optimization, and test execution, with the aim to mainly achieve the following two goals. First, uncertainty-wise testing aims to ensure that the SUT deals with known uncertainty adequately. Second, uncertainty-wise testing should be also capable of learning new (previously unknown) uncertainties such that the SUT's implementation can be improved to guard against newly learned uncertainties during its operation. The necessity to integrate uncertainty in testing is becoming imperative because of the emergence of new types of intelligent and communicating software-based systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Intrinsically, such systems are exposed to uncertainty because of their interactions with highly indeterminate physical environments. In this chapter, we provide our understanding and experience of uncertainty-wise testing from the aspects of uncertainty-wise model-based testing, uncertainty-wise modeling and evolution of test ready models, and uncertainty-wise multiobjective test optimization, in the context of testing CPSs under uncertainty. Furthermore, we present our vision about this new testing paradigm and its plausible future research directions.

               	   	In the cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) environments, quantifying uncertainty is an important element input to keep the acceptable level of reliability in various configurations. In this paper, we aim to address the pricing model of delivering data over the cloud while taking into consideration the dynamic uncertainty factors such as network topology, transmission/reception energy, nodal charge and power, and computation capacity. These uncertainty factors are mapped to different nodes with varying capabilities to be processed using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based algorithms. Accordingly, we aim to find a way to calculate and predict the price per big data service over the cloud using AI and deep learning. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework to address big data delivery issues in cloud-based IoT environments by considering uncertainty factors. We compare the performance of the framework using two AI-based techniques called Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) in both centralized and distributed versions. The use of AI techniques can be applied in multilevel to provide a kind of deep learning to further improve the performance of the system under study. The results reveal that the distributed algorithm outperforms the centralized one. In addition, the results show that the GA has lower running time compared to the SAA in all the test cases such as 68% of improvement in the centralized version, and 66% of improvement in the distributed version in case when the size of uncertainty array is 256. Moreover, when the size of uncertainty array increases, the results show 60% speed up in the distributed GA compared to its centralized version. The improvements achieved would help the service providers to actually improve their profit using the proposed framework.

               	   	Having a shared and accurate sense of time is critical to distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols, it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed systems with unprecedented accuracy. However, applications have not benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services that help manage time, and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces through which timing information flows to the application. Due to the importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications, running on commodity platforms and operating systems, it is imperative to rethink how time is handled across the system stack. We advocate the adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time (QoT) that captures metrics such as resolution, accuracy, and stability. Building on this notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time is a controllable operating system primitive with observable uncertainty, and where time synchronization balances applications' timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth. Our architecture features an expressive application programming interface that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline - a virtual temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide its components with a shared sense of time, with a desired accuracy and resolution. The timeline abstraction enables developers to easily write applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space. Leveraging open source hardware and software components, we have implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform. Results from its evaluation are also presented.

               	   	Development of robust dynamical systems and networks such as autonomous aircraft systems capable of accomplishing complex missions faces challenges due to the dynamically evolving uncertainties coming from model uncertainties, necessity to operate in a hostile cluttered urban environment, and the distributed and dynamic nature of the communication and computation resources. Model-based robust design is difficult because of the complexity of the hybrid dynamic models including continuous vehicle dynamics, the discrete models of computations and communications, and the size of the problem. We will overview recent advances in methodology and tools to model, analyze, and design robust autonomous aerospace systems operating in uncertain environment, with stress on efficient uncertainty quantification and robust design using the case studies of the mission including model-based target tracking and search, and trajectory planning in uncertain urban environment. To show that the methodology is generally applicable to uncertain dynamical systems, we will also show examples of application of the new methods to efficient uncertainty quantification of energy usage in buildings, and stability assessment of interconnected power networks.

                           Neural State Classification (NSC) [19] is a scalable method for the analysis of hybrid
                           systems, which consists in learning a neural network-based classifier able to detect whether
                           or not an unsafe state can be reached from a certain configuration of a hybrid system. NSC
                           has very high accuracy, yet it is prone to prediction errors that can affect system safety.
                           To overcome this limitation, we present a method, based on the theory of conformal
                           prediction, that complements NSC predictions with statistically sound estimates of prediction
                           uncertainty. This results in a principled criterion to reject potentially erroneous
                           predictions a priori, i.e., without knowing the true reachability values. Our approach is
                           highly efficient (with runtimes in the order of milliseconds) and effective, managing in our
                           experiments to successfully reject almost all the wrong NSC predictions.

               	   	The cyber-physical systems of Industry 4.0 are expected to generate vast amount of in-process data and revolutionise the way data, knowledge and wisdom is captured and reused in manufacturing industries. The goal is to increase profits by dramatically reducing the occurrence of unexpected process results and waste. ISO9001:2015 defines risk as effect of uncertainty. In the 7Epsilon context, the risk is defined as effect of uncertainty on expected results. The paper proposes a novel algorithm to embed risk based thinking in quantifying uncertainty in manufacturing operations during the tolerance synthesis process. This method uses penalty functions to mathematically represent deviation from expected results and solves the tolerance synthesis problem by proposing a quantile regression tree approach. The latter involves non parametric estimation of conditional quantiles of a response variable from in-process data and allows process engineers to discover and visualise optimal ranges that are associated with quality improvements. In order to quantify uncertainty and predict process robustness, a probabilistic approach, based on the likelihood ratio test with bootstrapping, is proposed which uses smoothed probability estimation of conditional probabilities. The mathematical formulation presented in this paper will allow organisations to extend Six Sigma process improvement principles in the Industry 4.0 context and implement the 7 steps of 7Epsilon in order to satisfy the requirements of clauses 6.1 and 7.1.6 of the ISO9001:2015 and the aerospace AS9100:2016 quality standard.

							Medical cyber-physical systems, such as the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), require evaluation of safety and efficacy in the context of a patient population in a clinical trial. Advances in computer modeling and simulation allow for generation of a simulated cohort or virtual cohort which mimics a patient population and can be used as a source of prior information. A major obstacle to acceptance of simulation results as a source of prior information is the lack of a framework for explicitly modeling sources of uncertainty in simulation results and quantifying the effect on trial outcomes.In this work, we formulate the Computer-Aided Clinical Trial (CACT) within a Bayesian statistical framework allowing explicit modeling of assumptions and utilization of simulation results at all stages of a clinical trial. To quantify the robustness of the CACT outcome with respect to a simulation assumption, we define δ-robustness as the minimum perturbation of the base prior distribution resulting in a change of the CACT outcome and provide a method to estimate the δ-robustness.We demonstrate the utility of the framework and how the results of δ-robustness evaluation can be utilized at various stages of a clinical trial through an application to the Rhythm ID Goes Head-to-head Trial (RIGHT), which was a comparative evaluation of the safety and efficacy of specific software algorithms across different implantable cardiac devices. Finally, we introduce a hardware interface that allows for direct interaction with the physical device in order to validate and confirm the results of a CACT for implantable cardiac devices.

                                With the rapid advances in sensing and digital technologies, cyber-physical systems are regarded as the most viable platforms for improving building design and management. Researchers investigated the possibility of integrating energy management systems with cyber-physical systems to form energy-cyber-physical systems in order to promote building energy management. However, minimizing energy consumption while fulfilling building functions for energy-cyber-physical systems is challenging due to the dynamics of building occupants. As occupant behavior is a major source of uncertainty for energy management, ignoring it often results in both energy waste caused by overheating and overcooling as well as discomfort due to insufficient thermal and ventilation services. To mitigate such uncertainties, this study proposes an occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical system that incorporates WiFi probe-based occupancy detection. The proposed framework utilizes ensemble classification algorithms to extract three forms of occupancy information. It creates a data interface to link energy management systems and cyber-physical systems and allows for automated occupancy detection and interpretation by assembling multiple weak classifiers for WiFi signals. A validation experiment in a large office room was conducted to examine the performance of the proposed occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical systems. The experiment and simulation results suggest that, with a proper classifier and occupancy data type, the proposed model can potentially save about 26.4% of energy consumption in cooling and ventilation demands.

                               Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is widely used to track and trace objects in supply chain management. However, massive uncertain data produced by RFID readers are not suitable for directly use in RFID applications. Following our thorough analysis of key features of RFID objects, this paper proposes a new framework for effectively and efficiently processing uncertain RFID data, and supporting a variety of queries for tracking and tracing RFID objects. In particular, we propose an adaptive cleaning method by adjusting size of smoothing window according to various rates of uncertain data, employing different strategies to process uncertain readings, and distinguishing different types of uncertain data according to their appearing positions. We propose a comprehensive data model, which is suitable for a wide range of application scenarios. In addition, a path coding scheme is proposed to significantly compress massive data by aggregating the path sequences, the positions and the time intervals. Experimental evaluations show that our approach is effective and efficient in terms of the compression and traceability queries.

               	   	Development of robust dynamical systems and networks such as autonomous aircraft systems capable of accomplishing complex missions faces challenges due to the dynamically evolving uncertainties coming from model uncertainties, necessity to operate in a hostile cluttered urban environment, and the distributed and dynamic nature of the communication and computation resources. Model-based robust design is difficult because of the complexity of the hybrid dynamic models including continuous vehicle dynamics, the discrete models of computations and communications, and the size of the problem. We will overview recent advances in methodology and tools to model, analyze, and design robust autonomous aerospace systems operating in uncertain environment, with stress on efficient uncertainty quantification and robust design using the case studies of the mission including model-based target tracking and search, and trajectory planning in uncertain urban environment. To show that the methodology is generally applicable to uncertain dynamical systems, we will also show examples of application of the new methods to efficient uncertainty quantification of energy usage in buildings, and stability assessment of interconnected power networks.

                           household. Current researches are more focused on the sheer technological (e.g., protocol

                           observation and others technical gaps makes it difficult to design a practical Smart Home

                           together with an efficient inference scheme which incorporates reasoning with uncertainty.

                              Predicting traffic flow is one of the fundamental needs to comfortable travel, but this task is challenging in vehicular cyber–physical systems because of ever-increasing uncertain traffic big data. Although deep-learning (DL) methods with outstanding performance recently have become popular, most existing DL models for traffic flow prediction are fully deterministic and shed no light on data uncertainty. In this study, a novel fuzzy deep-learning approach called FDCN is proposed for predicting citywide traffic flow. This approach is built on the fuzzy theory and the deep residual network model. Our key idea is to introduce the fuzzy representation into the DL model to lessen the impact of data uncertainty. A model of fuzzy deep convolutional network is established to improve traffic flow prediction while investigating the spatial and temporal correlation of traffic flow. We further propose pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that efficiently learn parameters of the FDCN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a fuzzy DL approach has been applied to represent traffic features for traffic flow prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach to traffic flow prediction has superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.                </td>

               	   	Programming embedded and cyber-physical systems requires attention not only to functional behavior and correctness, but also to non-functional aspects and specifically timing and performance. A structured, compositional, model-based approach based on stepwise refinement and abstraction techniques can support the development process, increase its quality and reduce development time through automation of synthesis, analysis or verification. Toward this, we introduce a theory of timed actors whose notion of refinement is based on the principle of worst-case design that permeates the world of performance-critical systems. This is in contrast with the classical behavioral and functional refinements based on restricting sets of behaviors. Our refinement allows time-deterministic abstractions to be made of time-non-deterministic systems, improving efficiency and reducing complexity of formal analysis. We show how our theory relates to, and can be used to reconcile existing time and performance models and their established theories.

                        Event processing follows a decoupled model of interaction in space, time, and synchronization. However, another dimension of semantic coupling also exists and poses a challenge to the scalability of event processing systems in highly semantically heterogeneous and dynamic environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Current state-of-the-art approaches of content-based and concept-based event systems require a significant agreement between event producers and consumers on event schema or an external conceptual model of event semantics. Thus, they do not address the semantic coupling issue. This article proposes an approach where participants only agree on a distributional statistical model of semantics represented in a corpus of text to derive semantic similarity and relatedness. It also proposes an approximate model for relaxing the semantic coupling dimension via an approximation-enabled rule language and an approximate event matcher. The model is formalized as an ensemble of semantic and top-k matchers along with a probability model for uncertainty management. The model has been empirically validated on large sets of events and subscriptions synthesized from real-world smart city and energy management systems. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves more than 95% F1Score of effectiveness and thousands of events/sec of throughput for medium degrees of approximation while not requiring users to have complete prior knowledge of event semantics. In semantically loosely-coupled environments, one approximate subscription can compensate for hundreds of exact subscriptions to cover all possibilities in environments which require complete prior knowledge of event semantics. Results indicate that approximate semantic event processing could play a promising role in the IoT middleware layer.

                               A critical issue in the Web of Things (WoT) is the need to process and analyze the interactions of Web-interconnected real-world objects. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a powerful technology for analyzing streams of information about real-time distributed events, coming from different sources, and for extracting conclusions from them. However, in many situations these events are not free from uncertainty, due to either unreliable data sources and networks, measurement uncertainty, or to the inability to determine whether an event has actually happened or not. This short research paper discusses how CEP systems can incorporate different kinds of uncertainty, both in the events and in the rules. A case study is used to validate the proposal, and we discuss the benefits and limitations of this CEP extension.

                                The popular use of wearable devices and mobile phones makes the effective capture of life-logging physical activity (PA) data in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment possible. The effective collection of measures of PA in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers and patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, life-logging PA information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this study, the authors project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as daily activity in physical space and present an ellipse-fitting model-based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging PA measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method remarkably improves the validity of PA measures in a healthcare platform.

               	   			The utility of wearables is currently limited to lab experiments and controlled environments mainly because computational algorithms embedded in wearables fail to produce accurate measurements in uncontrolled, dynamically changing, and potentially harsh environments. With the exponentially growing adoption of these systems in human-centered Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, development of resource-efficient solutions to enhance the accuracy of this systems remains a considerable research challenge. In this paper, we introduce an energy-efficient framework for uncertainty management of networked wearables. The core components of our framework are anomaly screening units for detecting anomalies that require handling, thus resulting in one order of magnitude less energy consumption compared to the conventional frameworks. Furthermore, our screening approach achieves 98.3% accuracy in detecting anomalies based on real data collected with wearable motion sensors.

                                Timeliness, accuracy and effectiveness of manufacturing information in manufacturing and business process management have become important factors of constraint to business growth. Single RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology with uncertainty will cause great difficulties for application systems. This paper mainly focuses on the process of manufacturing information, real-time information perception and processing problems. It achieves real-time manufacturing information acquisition and processing by combining RFID and sensor technology, which uses Complex Event Processing (CEP) mechanism to realize sensor and RFID data fusion. First of all, the event processing framework which is from the perspective of the integration of sensors and RFID is given. Then, real-time acquisition and intelligent information processing models were introduced, including primitive event handling and complex event processing method. Finally, the practicality of our method was verified through applying it to a mold manufacturing enterprise management field.

                               Device-to-device communication is widely used for mobile devices and Internet of Things. Authentication and key agreement are critical to build a secure channel between two devices. However, existing approaches often rely on a pre-built fingerprint database and suffer from low key generation rate. We present GeneWave, a fast device authentication and key agreement protocol for commodity mobile devices. GeneWave first achieves bidirectional initial authentication based on the physical response interval between two devices. To keep the accuracy of interval estimation, we eliminate time uncertainty on commodity devices through fast signal detection and redundancy time cancellation. Then, we derive the initial acoustic channel response for device authentication. We design a novel coding scheme for efficient key agreement while ensuring security. Therefore, two devices can authenticate each other and securely agree on a symmetric key. GeneWave requires neither special hardware nor pre-built fingerprint database, and thus it is easyto-use on commercial mobile devices. We implement GeneWave on mobile devices (i.e., Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P) and evaluate its performance through extensive experiments. Experimental results show that GeneWave efficiently accomplish secure key agreement on commodity smartphones with a key generation rate 10× faster than the state-of-the-art approach.

                             Recently, the popular use of wearable devices and mobile apps makes the effectively capture of lifelogging physical activity data in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment possible. The effective collection of measures of physical activity in the long term is beneficial to interdisciplinary healthcare research and collaboration from clinicians, researchers to patients. However, due to heterogeneity of connected devices and rapid change of diverse life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging physical activity information captured by mobile devices usually contains much uncertainty. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing life-logging physical activity measurement devices, and identify regular and irregular uncertainties of these activity measures in an IoT environment. We then project the distribution of irregular uncertainty by defining a walking speed related score named as Daily Activity in Physical Space (DAPS). Finally, we present an ellipse fitting model based validity improvement method for reducing uncertainties of life-logging physical activity measures in an IoT environment. The experimental results reflect that the proposed method effectively improves the validity of physical activity measures in a healthcare platform.

                             Internet of Things (IoT) technology offers opportunities to monitor lifelogging data by a variety of assets, like wearable sensors, mobile apps, etc. But due to heterogeneity of connected devices and diverse human life patterns in an IoT environment, lifelogging personal data contains huge uncertainty and are hardly used for healthcare studies. Effective validation of lifelogging personal data for longitudinal health assessment is demanded. In this paper, lifelogging physical activity (LPA) is taken as a target to explore how to improve the validity of lifelogging data in an IoT enabled healthcare system. A rule-based adaptive LPA validation (LPAV) model, LPAV-IoT, is proposed for eliminating irregular uncertainties (IUs) and estimating data reliability in IoT healthcare environments. A methodology specifying four layers and three modules in LPAV-IoT is presented for analyzing key factors impacting validity of LPA. A series of validation rules are designed with uncertainty threshold parameters and reliability indicators and evaluated through experimental investigations. Following LPAV-IoT, a case study on a personalized healthcare platform myhealthavatar connecting three state-of-the-art wearable devices and mobile apps are carried out. The results reflect that the rules provided by LPAV-IoT enable efficiently filtering at least 75% of IU and adaptively indicating the reliability of LPA data on certain condition of IoT environments.

                            Adaptive systems are expected to adapt to unanticipated run-time events using imperfect information about themselves, their environment, and goals. This entails handling the effects of uncertainties in decision-making, which are not always considered as a first-class concern. This paper contributes a formal analysis technique that explicitly considers uncertainty in sensing when reasoning about the best way to adapt, together with uncertainty reduction mechanisms to improve system utility. We illustrate our approach on a Denial of Service (DoS) attack scenario and present results that demonstrate the benefits of uncertainty-aware decision-making in comparison to using an uncertainty-ignorant approach, both in the presence and absence of uncertainty reduction mechanisms.

               	   			The correct representation of the relevant properties of a system is an essential requirement for the effective use and wide
											  adoption of model-based practices in industry. Uncertainty is one of the inherent properties of any measurement or estimation
										  	that is obtained in any physical setting; as such, it must be considered when modeling software systems deal with real data.
										 	  Although a few modeling languages enable the representation of measurement uncertainty, these aspects are not normally
								      	incorporated into their type systems. Therefore, operating with uncertain values and propagating their uncertainty become
											  cumbersome processes, which hinder their realization in real environments. This paper proposes an extension of OCL/UML
   											primitive datatypes that enables the representation of the uncertainty that comes from physical measurements or user estimates
												into the models, together with an algebra of operations that are defined for the values of these types

               	   			Uncertainty is an inherent property of any measure or estimation performed in any physical setting, and therefore it needs to be considered when modeling systems that manage real data. Although several modeling languages permit the representation of measurement uncertainty for describing certain system attributes, these aspects are not normally incorporated into their type systems. Thus, operating with uncertain values and propagating uncertainty are normally cumbersome processes, difficult to achieve at the model level. This paper proposes an extension of OCL and UML datatypes to incorporate data uncertainty coming from physical measurements or user estimations into the models, along with the set of operations defined for the values of these types.

               	   			As Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical systems become more ubiquitous and an integral part of our daily lives, it is important that we are able to trust the data aggregate from such systems. However, the interpretation of trustworthiness is contextual and varies according to the risk tolerance attitude of the concerned application and varying levels of uncertainty associated with the evidence upon which trust models act. Hence, the data integrity scoring mechanisms should have provisions to adapt to varying risk attitudes and uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian inference model and a prospect theoretic framework for data integrity scoring that quantify the trustworthiness of data collected from IoT devices by a hub in the presence of an adversary manipulating data and an imperfect anomaly monitoring mechanism. The monitoring mechanism monitors the data being sent from each device and classifies the outcome as not compromised, compromised, and cannot be inferred. These outcomes are conceptualized as a multinomial hypothesis of a Bayesian inference model with three parameters which are then used for calculating a utility value on how reliable the aggregate data is. We use prospect theory inspired approach to quantify this data integrity score and evaluate trustworthiness of the aggregate data from the IoT framework. As decisions are based on how the data is fused, we propose two measuring models-one optimistic and another conservative. The proposed framework is validated using extensive simulation experiments. We show how data integrity scores vary under a variety of system factors like attack intensity and inaccurate detection.

               	   			Trust and uncertainty are important aspects of many distributed systems. Managing them together forms a complex problem, even more in the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), where having multiple sources of information is very common. The devices of the IoT face two-fold problems of managing trust on sources and the presence of uncertainty in the information. We propose a solution to these problems. Our solution approach involves modeling applications of the IoT as intelligent agents that comprise a trust management module, an inference engine and an enhanced Assumption-based Truth Maintenance System (ATMS) to manage trust of the information sources and uncertainty of the inferred information. We validate our approach using empirical data obtained from simulations.

                           In many IoT applications, sensor nodes are distributed over a region of interests and collect
                           data at a specified time interval. With the development of hardware, the monitoring tasks
                           become diversity. The specified acquisition strategy can not adaptively adjust the sampling
                           interval. Due to the measurement error and the uncertainty of the environment, equi-frequency
                           sampling technique may result in misunderstandings to the physical world. Based on Taylor
                           expansion and time series analysis, this paper presents a sensed data model. The model can be
                           considered as a unified approach, where linear regression or spline interpolation is a
                           special case of our model. A mathematical method for parameter estimation is proposed, which
                           can minimize the measurement error. And we prove the estimation is unbias. An adaptive data
                           acquisition algorithm is proposed. Performance evaluation on the real data set verifies that
                           the proposed algorithms have high performance in terms of accuracy and effectiveness.

            Localization underwater has been known to be challenging due to the limited accessibility of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to obtain absolute positions. This becomes more severe in the under-ice environment since the ocean surface is covered with ice, making it more difficult to access GPS or to deploy localization infrastructure. In this paper, a novel solution that minimizes localization uncertainty and communication overhead of under-ice Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is proposed. Existing underwater localization solutions generally rely on reference nodes at ocean surface or on localization infrastructure to calculate positions, and they are not able to estimate the localization uncertainty, which may lead to the increase of localization error. In contrast, using the notion of external uncertainty (i.e., the position uncertainty as seen by others), our solution can characterize an AUV’s position with a probability model. This model is further used to estimate the uncertainty associated with our proposed localization techniques. Based on this uncertainty estimate, we further propose algorithms to minimize localization uncertainty and communication overhead. Our solution is emulated and compared against existing solutions, showing improved performance.                </td>

                     Recently there has been increasing engineering activity in the deployment of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Different types of AUVs are being used for applications ranging from ocean exploration to coastal tactical surveillance. These AUVs generally follow a predictable trajectory specified by the mission requirements. Inaccuracies in models for deriving position estimates and the drift caused by ocean currents, however, lead to uncertainty when estimating an AUV’s position. In this article, two forms of position uncertainty – internal and external – are studied, which are the position uncertainty associated with a particular AUV as seen by itself and that as seen by others, respectively. Then, a statistical model to estimate the internal uncertainty for a general AUV is proposed. Based on this model, a novel mathematical framework using Unscented Kalman Filtering is developed to estimate the external uncertainty. Finally, the benefits of this framework for several location-sensitive applications are shown via emulations.                </td>

                           With the significant advancements in Information and Communications Technology (ICT), cloud based applications provide a novel approach to access applications which are not installed on the local computers. The integration of cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) indicated a bright future of the Internet. In this paper, a new architecture of cloud computing—Model as a Service (MaaS) is proposed. The feasibility of the proposed architecture is proved by implementing a groundwater model on cloud as a case study. The groundwater model is established using MODFLOW for the middle reach of the Heihe River Basin (HRB). The model is calibrated using in situ observation to ensure capability of simulating the groundwater process with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.70 m and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.64. The parameter uncertainties of the groundwater model are analyzed by sequential data assimilation algorithms (PF, Particle Filter; EnKF, Ensemble Kalman Filter) in a synthetic case. The results show that the parameter uncertainties are effectively reduced by incorporating observed information recursively. A comparison between PF and EnKF indicate that the results from PF are slightly better than those from EnKF. The integration shows a bright future for simulating the groundwater system in real-time. This study provides a flexible and effective approach for analyzing the uncertainties and time variant properties of the parameters and the proposed architecture of cloud computing provides a novel approach for the researchers and decision-makers to construct numerical models and follow-up researches.                </td>

                     Predicting traffic flow is one of the fundamental needs to comfortable travel, but this task is challenging in vehicular cyber–physical systems because of ever-increasing uncertain traffic big data. Although deep-learning (DL) methods with outstanding performance recently have become popular, most existing DL models for traffic flow prediction are fully deterministic and shed no light on data uncertainty. In this study, a novel fuzzy deep-learning approach called FDCN is proposed for predicting citywide traffic flow. This approach is built on the fuzzy theory and the deep residual network model. Our key idea is to introduce the fuzzy representation into the DL model to lessen the impact of data uncertainty. A model of fuzzy deep convolutional network is established to improve traffic flow prediction while investigating the spatial and temporal correlation of traffic flow. We further propose pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that efficiently learn parameters of the FDCN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a fuzzy DL approach has been applied to represent traffic features for traffic flow prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach to traffic flow prediction has superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.                </td>

                           This keynote talk and paper intend to motivate research projects that investigate novel ways to model, analyze, and mitigate uncertainty arising in three different aspects of the cyber-physical systems. First, uncertainty about the physical environment can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes catastrophic, results as the system tries to adapt to unanticipated or poorly-understood environmental conditions. Second, uncertainty in the cyber environment can have lead to unexpected and adverse effects, including not only performance impacts (load, traffic, etc.) but also potential threats or overt attacks. Finally, uncertainty can exist with the components themselves and how they interact upon reconfiguration, including unexpected and unwanted feature interactions. Each of these sources of uncertainty can potentially be identified at different stages, respectively run time, design time, and requirements, but their mitigation might be done at the same or a different stage. Based on the related literature and our preliminary investigations, we argue that the following three overarching techniques are essential and warrant further research to provide enabling technologies to address uncertainty at all three stages: model-based development, assurance, and dynamic adaptation. Furthermore, we posit that in order to go beyond incremental improvements to current software engineering techniques, we need to leverage, extend, and integrate techniques from other disciplines.                </td>

                As a new intelligent manufacturing model, the Internet of Manufacturing Things (IOMT) based on the Internet of Things technology has a large amount of random, fuzzy, and uncertain information, which makes the optimization of manufacturing services face challenges. On the basis of fully considering the uncertain factors in the process of manufacturing service, a quality of service (QoS) optimization method based on mixed information axioms is proposed to solve the optimization problem of manufacturing service in the IOMT environment. The mixed uncertainty model is expounded with random variables to express the range of system and fuzzy variables to describe the design range. In order to select the best resource or sort, the fuzzy mathematics and the axiomatic theory of axiomatic design theory are combined to evaluate the coexistence of ambiguity and randomness of the QoS. Finally, the process of treatment and optimization in practical application by taking the example of a hydraulic pump product seeking service through the civil aircraft IOMT service platform is described. This example is given out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with the traditional information axiom method, and this method extends the application scope of traditional information axioms.

                            This paper presents initial results towards a realizable framework for the safety critical controlled invariance of cyber-physical systems. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a control barrier function based methodology which can be used to enforce set invariance on systems in the presence of non-linear disturbances and uncertainty. The first part of this work is a review of the current methods available for finding viable sets and how they are linked to practical choices regarding safety. Their limitations and directions towards improvements when it comes to handling model uncertainty are also highlighted. The second part of this work is the formulation of a condition which can guarantee set invariance in the presence of generic uncertain in the dynamics. An associated optimization problem to enforce that condition is proposed and a method to convexify the problem and make it solvable in real-time is formally presented. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is illustrated experimentally on a two-wheeled inverted pendulum.

                       This paper presents a sound and complete fault detection approach for cyber–physical systems represented by hidden-mode switched affine models with time varying parametric uncertainty. The fault detection approach builds upon techniques from model invalidation. In particular, a set-membership approach is taken where the noisy input–output data is compared to the set of behaviors of a nominal model. As we show, this set-membership check can be reduced to the feasibility of a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which can be solved efficiently by leveraging the state-of-the-art MILP solvers. In the second part of the paper, given a system model and a fault model, the concept of -detectability is introduced. If a pair of system and fault models satisfies -detectability property for a finite , this allows the model invalidation algorithm to be implemented in a receding horizon manner, without compromising detection guarantees. In addition, the concept of weak-detectability is introduced which extends the proposed approach to a more expressive class of fault models that capture language constraints on the mode sequences. Finally, the efficiency of the approach is illustrated with numerical examples motivated by smart building radiant systems.

                        A self-adaptive cyber-physical system (SACPS) can adjust its behavior and configurations at runtime in response to varying requirements obtained from the system and the environment. With the increasing use of the SACPS in different application domains, such variations are becoming more common. Users today expect the SACPS to guarantee its functional and timing behavior even in adverse environmental situations. However, uncertainties in the SACPS environment impose challenges on assuring the runtime behavior during system design.
                       Software product line engineering (SPLE) is considered as a useful technique for handling varying requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for assuring the runtime behavior of the SACPS by applying an SPLE technique such as feature modeling. By representing the feature-based model at design time, we characterize the possible adaptation requirements to reusable configurations. The proposed approach aims to model two dynamic variability dimensions: 1) environment variability that describes the conditions under which the SACPS must adapt, and 2) structural variability, that defines the resulting architectural configurations. To validate our approach, the experimental analysis is performed using two case studies: 1) a traffic monitoring SACPS and 2) an automotive SACPS. We demonstrate that the proposed feature-based modeling approach can be used to achieve adaptivity which allows the SACPS to assure functional (defining execution of the correct set of adaptive tasks) and non-functional (defining execution of SACPS in the expected mode) correctness at runtime. The experimental results show that the feature-based SACPS demonstrates significant improvement in terms of self-configuration time, self-adaptation time and scalability with less probability of failure in different environmental situations.

							Medical cyber-physical systems, such as the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), require evaluation of safety and efficacy in the context of a patient population in a clinical trial. Advances in computer modeling and simulation allow for generation of a simulated cohort or virtual cohort which mimics a patient population and can be used as a source of prior information. A major obstacle to acceptance of simulation results as a source of prior information is the lack of a framework for explicitly modeling sources of uncertainty in simulation results and quantifying the effect on trial outcomes.In this work, we formulate the Computer-Aided Clinical Trial (CACT) within a Bayesian statistical framework allowing explicit modeling of assumptions and utilization of simulation results at all stages of a clinical trial. To quantify the robustness of the CACT outcome with respect to a simulation assumption, we define δ-robustness as the minimum perturbation of the base prior distribution resulting in a change of the CACT outcome and provide a method to estimate the δ-robustness.We demonstrate the utility of the framework and how the results of δ-robustness evaluation can be utilized at various stages of a clinical trial through an application to the Rhythm ID Goes Head-to-head Trial (RIGHT), which was a comparative evaluation of the safety and efficacy of specific software algorithms across different implantable cardiac devices. Finally, we introduce a hardware interface that allows for direct interaction with the physical device in order to validate and confirm the results of a CACT for implantable cardiac devices.

							With the emergence of the Internet of Things and smart devices, smart homes are becoming more and more popular. The main goal of this study is to implement an event driven system in a smart home and to extract meaningful information from the raw data collected by the deployed sensors using Complex Event Processing (CEP). These high-level events can then be used by multiple smart home applications in particular situation identification. However, in real life scenarios, low-level events are generally uncertain. In fact, an event may be outdated, inaccurate, imprecise or in contradiction with another one. This can lead to misinterpretation from CEP and the associated applications. To overcome these weaknesses, in this paper, we propose a Fuzzy Semantic Complex Event Processing (FSCEP) model which can represent and reason with events by including domain knowledge and integrating fuzzy logic. It handles multiple dimensions of uncertainty, namely freshness, accuracy, precision and contradiction. FSCEP has been implemented and compared with a well known CEP. The results show how some ambiguities are solved.

					[Context/ Motivation] A smart device is a software-intensive system that operates autonomously and interacts to some degree with other systems over wireless connections. Such systems are often faced with uncertainty in the environment. Runtime representations of requirements have recently gained more interested to deal with this challenge and the term requirements at runtime has been established. Runtime representations of requirements support reasoning about the requirements at runtime and adapting the configuration of a system according to changes in the environment. [Questions/Problems] The research question is how the results of runtime monitoring of requirements and the system’s decisions about changes in the configuration are communicated back to the requirements engineer to better understand the environment. There is a gap between the written requirements document and the dynamic requirements model inside the system. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that a requirements document are mostly informal while the dynamic requirements model is formal. [Principal ideas/results] This paper introduces an approach to bridge the gap between development time and runtime representations of requirements in order to keep them consistent and to facilitate better understanding. We propose to weave the feedback from the runtime system into requirements documents using a domain-specific language that largely retain the informal nature of requirements. An annotated requirements document helps get a better understanding of the system’s actual behavior in a given environment. The approach is implemented using mbeddr, a novel set of domain-specific languages for developing embedded systems, and illustrated using a running example.

						When creating the Internet of Things and Smart Machines, the RULES ENGINE pattern is developed. The tasks that Rules Engine solves in real time are characterized by large amounts of data from various sensors. To account for uncertainty, a new model of Smart Rules Engine is proposed with a two-step inference engine, including an engine of abstraction from data. A model based on quantitative, definitive and generalization type of abstraction is considered. It is shown that the proposed model solves the problem of the bridge between natural language, as a carrier of the concept's meaning, and data from sensors, as carriers of the perception. A model for presenting a prototype is given in which incomplete knowledge, expert's uncertainty in the definition of the concept and aging of data are taken into account. The prototype and data model representation and the abstraction engine are built based on fuzzy L-R numbers and arithmetic operations on them. The preliminary step of abstraction from the data, besides taking into account the uncertainty of a different nature, significantly reduces the dimension of the fuzzy inference space. A comparison of the two-step fuzzy inference engine with the traditional inference engine Fuzzy Logic System Type-1 is given using the example of a wheeled robot making the decision to safely cross an unregulated crossroad.

						In recent years, expectations for large-scale wireless sensor networks have been rapidly increased due to miniaturization, cost reduction, reduction in power consumption of wireless sensor devices, and the emergence of wireless sensor network applications such as IoT (Internet Of Things). However, in addition to the uncertainty inherent in wireless sensor networks, due to the uncertainty caused by the expansion of wireless sensor networks, it is not easy to realize a highly efficient and reliable large-scale wireless sensor network. The uncertainty of wireless sensor networks is classified into three types: the uncertainty of nodes such as sensor nodes and sink nodes, the uncertainty of wireless communication links among nodes, and the uncertainty of traffic transferred over the wireless sensor network. In this paper, as a wireless communication standard, we focus on IEEE 802.15.4, which is designed for short-range wireless networks called PANs (Personal Area Networks), and analyze large-scale wireless sensor networks using fluid approximation. Specifically, IEEE 802.15.4 large-scale wireless sensor networks are analyzed by extending the modeling approach for generic CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) wireless networks. Moreover, our analysis makes it possible to probabilistically model temporal fluctuation of wireless communication ranges of nodes as network uncertainty. As a result, our analysis clarifies the effect of link uncertainty on the average message delivery delay in wireless sensor networks.

						Program variables used in robotic and cyber-physical systems often have implicit physical units that cannot be determined from their variable types. Inferring an abstract physical unit type for variables and checking their physical unit type consistency is of particular importance for validating the correctness of such systems. For instance, a variable with the unit of ‘meter’ should not be assigned to another variable with the unit of ‘degree-per-second’. Existing solutions have various limitations such as requiring developers to annotate variables with physical units and only handling variables that are directly or transitively used in popular robotic libraries with known physical unit information. We observe that there are a lot of physical unit hints in these softwares such as variable names and specific forms of expressions. These hints have uncertainty as developers may not respect conventions. We propose to model them with probability distributions and conduct probabilistic inference. At the end, our technique produces a unit distribution for each variable. Unit inconsistencies can then be detected using the highly probable unit assignments. Experimental results on 30 programs show that our technique can infer units for 159.3% more variables compared to the state-of-the-art with more than 88.7% true positives, and inconsistencies detection on 90 programs shows that our technique reports 103.3% more inconsistencies with 85.3% true positives.

These event streams often are uncertain due to the limit of the monitoring device and the high speed of vehicles. Developing an event processing language to process these spatio-temporal event streams with uncertainty is a challenge issue. The goal of this paper is to develop a Probabilistic Event Processing Language, called as Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Event Processing language (PSTEP, shortly), dealing with this challenge issue. In PSTEP, we use the Possible World Model to express uncertain spatio-temporal events of IoV and assign a spatio-temporal event with a probability which is the threshold value for processing the existence of an event. We establish its syntax and operational semantics. Finally, a case study is given to show the effectiveness of the PSTEP language.

               	   Self-healing cyber-physical systems (SH-CPSs) detect and recover from faults by themselves at runtime. Testing such systems is challenging due to the complex implementation of self-healing behaviors and their interaction with the physical environment, both of which are uncertain. To this end, we propose an executable model-based approach to test self-healing behaviors under environmental uncertainties. The approach consists of a Modeling Framework of SH-CPSs (MoSH) and an accompanying Test Model Executor (TM-Executor). MoSH provides a set of modeling constructs and a methodology to specify executable test models, which capture expected system behaviors and environmental uncertainties. TM-Executor executes the test models together with the systems under test, to dynamically test their self-healing behaviors under uncertainties. We demonstrated the successful application of MoSH to specify 11 self-healing behaviors and 17 uncertainties for three SH-CPSs. The time spent by TM-Executor to perform testing activities was in the order of milliseconds, though the time spent was strongly correlated with the complexity of test models.

                               A critical issue in the Web of Things (WoT) is the need to process and analyze the interactions of Web-interconnected real-world objects. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a powerful technology for analyzing streams of information about real-time distributed events, coming from different sources, and for extracting conclusions from them. However, in many situations these events are not free from uncertainty, due to either unreliable data sources and networks, measurement uncertainty, or to the inability to determine whether an event has actually happened or not. This short research paper discusses how CEP systems can incorporate different kinds of uncertainty, both in the events and in the rules. A case study is used to validate the proposal, and we discuss the benefits and limitations of this CEP extension.

                                A challenging issue in the architectural design of a System-of-Systems (SoS) is how to cope with the uncertainty raised by the limited knowledge of the operational environment where the SoS will actually be deployed as well as the constituent systems which will concretely participate in the SoS at run-time. It is especially the case of SoSs being architected on the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Indeed, due to the open and dynamic nature of the IoT, on the one hand, at design-time, most often the SoS architects do not know which will be the concrete IoT systems that will become constituents of an SoS, these being predominantly identified at run-time; on the other hand, the correct architecture depends not only on the constituent IoT systems but also, largely, on the operational environment where the SoS will be positioned on the IoT. The consequent research question is thereby how to design and describe the SoS architecture in a way that is flexible enough to cope with these different uncertainties. To address this challenge, this paper investigates the notion of uncertainty in SoS and presents how SosADL, a formal SoS Architecture Description Language (ADL), enables to cope with uncertainty in the architecture modeling of SoSs. It presents the concepts and constructs that makes possible to describe SoS architectures which will operate in unpredictable environments on the IoT based on the SosADL support for dealing with partial knowledge, grounded on concurrent constraints.

               	   			Trust and uncertainty are important aspects of many distributed systems. Managing them together forms a complex problem, even more in the domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), where having multiple sources of information is very common. The devices of the IoT face two-fold problems of managing trust on sources and the presence of uncertainty in the information. We propose a solution to these problems. Our solution approach involves modeling applications of the IoT as intelligent agents that comprise a trust management module, an inference engine and an enhanced Assumption-based Truth Maintenance System (ATMS) to manage trust of the information sources and uncertainty of the inferred information. We validate our approach using empirical data obtained from simulations.

               	   			Industry 4.0 is the fourth and current working paradigm leaning on data exchange, data analysis and Internet of things for complete automation and optimization of manufacturing technologies. This 4.0 paradigm enables the possibility for optimal autonomous decision making and full autonomous operation of the facility. Since all manufacturing processes are inherently in-deterministic, optimal decision making will only work when provided with realistic uncertainty models. The authors have observed that the typical used prediction models are not accurate as they do not represent the in-deterministic nature of the processes in a realistic manner. The objective of this paper is to use the IoT- based logged data to design more relevant uncertainty models to optimize the industry 4.0 framework. For this purpose, p-box models are used to represent production variation as function of unknown in-deterministic parameters. Furthermore, by using regression learning on the database, we show that the uncertainty can be decreased. It is shown that classic stochastic models are not able to capture the full in-deterministic nature of the uncertainties. It makes therefore sense that autonomous decision making based on such stochastic models are unreliable and sub-optimal. Future research possibilities are discussed, based on the proposed uncertainty models, together with possible notions that will help in the development of reliable optimal decision making and more accurate adaptable Industry 4.0 framework.

                                Process algebra is one of the best suitable formal methods to model smart systems based on IoT, especially Smart Factory. However, because of some uncertainty, it is necessary to model predictability of the systems, based on the uncertainty. There have been several process algebras with probability, such as, PAROMA, PACSR, etc. However they are not well suitable for the smart systems, since they are based only on discrete model or exponential model. Consequently, only simple or targeted probability can be specified and analyzed. In order to handle such limitations, the paper presents a new formal method, called dTP-Calculus, extended from the existing dT-Calculus with discrete, normal, exponential, and uniform probability models. It provides all the possible probability features for Smart Factory with complex uncertainty. The specification of the modeling will be simulated statistically for Smart Factory, and further the simulation results will be analyzed for probabilistic properties of the systems. For implementation, a tool set for the calculus has been developed in the SAVE tool suite on the ADOxx Meta-Modeling Platform, including Specifier, Analyzer and Verifier. A Smart Factory example from Audi Cell Production System has been selected as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

                                In this paper, we present a new tool SReach, which solves probabilistic bounded reachability problems for two classes of models of stochastic hybrid systems. The first one is (nonlinear) hybrid automata with parametric uncertainty. The second one is probabilistic hybrid automata with additional randomness for both transition probabilities and variable resets. Standard approaches to reachability problems for linear hybrid systems require numerical solutions for large optimization problems, and become infeasible for systems involving both nonlinear dynamics over the reals and stochasticity. SReach encodes stochastic information by using a set of introduced random variables, and combines  \(\delta \) -complete decision procedures and statistical tests to solve  \(\delta \) -reachability problems in a sound manner. Compared to standard simulation-based methods, it supports non-deterministic branching, increases the coverage of simulation, and avoids the zero-crossing problem. We demonstrate SReach’s applicability by discussing three representative biological models and additional benchmarks for nonlinear hybrid systems with multiple probabilistic system parameters.

                             With the economic globalization and the intensification of market competition, competition between enterprises has developed into competition between supply chains. The influence and change of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology on the spatial structure and economic relationship of supply chain are all-round and profound, and then affect the allocation of resources and supply chain operation, which will lead to many new management problems. These problems will become a new field of enterprise supply chain management innovation. Based on the fuzzy theory, this paper uses six-point fuzzy numbers to represent the uncertainty in the supply chain and uses the possibility theory to establish the evaluation criteria for the overall performance of the supply chain. In order to satisfy the constraints of the final product order fulfillment rate and minimize the overall inventory cost of the supply chain, the model integrates and optimizes the manufacturing resource allocation strategy of the supply chain in the IoT. Finally, the effectiveness of the model is verified by simulation, which provides theoretical support for the decision-making of the supply chain enterprises in the IoT environment

                            It is important that a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with uncertainty in its behavior caused by its unpredictable operating environment, to ensure its reliable operation. One method to ensure that the CPS will handle such uncertainty during its operation is by testing the CPS with model-based testing (MBT) techniques. However, existing MBT techniques do not explicitly capture uncertainty in test ready models, i.e., capturing the uncertain expected behavior of a CPS in the presence of environment uncertainty. To fill this gap, we present an Uncertainty-Wise test-modeling framework, named as UncerTum, to create test ready models to support MBT of CPSs facing uncertainty. UncerTum relies on the definition of a UML profile [the UML Uncertainty Profile (UUP)] and a set of UML Model Libraries extending the UML profile for Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time and Embedded Systems (MARTE). UncerTum also benefits from the UML Testing Profile V.2 to support standard-based MBT. UncerTum was evaluated with two industrial CPS case studies, one real-world case study, and one open-source CPS case study from the following four perspectives: (1) Completeness and Coverage of the profiles and Model Libraries in terms of concepts defined in their underlying uncertainty conceptual model for CPSs, i.e., U-Model and MARTE, (2) Effort required to model uncertainty with UncerTum, and (3) Correctness of the developed test ready models, which was assessed via model execution. Based on the evaluation, we can conclude that we were successful in modeling all the uncertainties identified in the four case studies, which gives us an indication that UncerTum is sufficiently complete. In terms of modeling effort, we concluded that on average UncerTum requires 18.5% more time to apply stereotypes from UUP on test ready models.

                            Uncertainty is intrinsic in most technical systems, including Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Therefore, handling uncertainty in a graceful manner during the real operation of CPS is critical. Since designing, developing, and testing modern and highly sophisticated CPS is an expanding field, a step towards dealing with uncertainty is to identify, define, and classify uncertainties at various levels of CPS. This will help develop a systematic and comprehensive understanding of uncertainty. To that end, we propose a conceptual model for uncertainty specifically designed for CPS. Since the study of uncertainty in CPS development and testing is still irrelatively unexplored, this conceptual model was derived in a large part by reviewing existing work on uncertainty in other fields, including philosophy, physics, statistics, and healthcare. The conceptual model is mapped to the three logical levels of CPS: Application, Infrastructure, and Integration. It is captured using UML class diagrams, including relevant OCL constraints. To validate the conceptual model, we identified, classified, and specified uncertainties in two distinct industrial case studies.

               	   	    The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices within homes raises many security and privacy concerns. Recent headlines highlight the lack of effective security mechanisms in IoT devices. Security threats in IoT arise not only from vulnerabilities in individual devices but also from the composition of devices in unanticipated ways and the ability of devices to interact through both cyber and physical channels. Existing approaches provide methods for monitoring cyber interactions between devices but fail to consider possible physical interactions. To overcome this challenge, it is essential that security assessments of IoT networks take a holistic view of the network and treat it as a "system of systems", in which security is defined, not solely by the individual systems, but also by the interactions and trust dependencies between systems.
                        In this paper, we propose a way of modeling cyber and physical interactions between IoT devices of a given network. By verifying the cyber and physical interactions against user-defined policies, our model can identify unexpected chains of events that may be harmful. It can also be applied to determine the impact of the addition (or removal) of a device into an existing network with respect to dangerous device interactions.
                        We demonstrate the viability of our approach by instantiating our model using Alloy, a language and tool for relational models. In our evaluation, we considered three realistic IoT use cases and demonstrate that our model is capable of identifying potentially dangerous device interactions. We also measure the performance of our approach with respect to the CPU runtime and memory consumption of the Alloy model finder, and show that it is acceptable for smart-home IoT networks.

               	   	  The electric grid had become a vast complex cyber-physical system, and its digitalization is a reality in the close future that would result in a tremendous amount of information, controls, and uncertainties. Distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed generation (DG), demand response (DR), distributed energy storage systems (DESS), and electric vehicle (EV) are increasing the level of uncertainty but also the capabilities of new controls on the distribution networks. The future electric grid will need more flexibility and coordination between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to be able to operate in a reliable, secure and economical fashion. To overcome uncertainties and reliability issues, DSO is moving toward the so-called active distribution network (ADN) which is the crucial piece of for enabling new flexibility at the TSO level. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the estimation of the ADNs flexibility based on the feasibility region at the TSO-DSO interface. A Monte Carlo sampling method is applied to generate random ADN states. The proposed methodology is analyzed in both the 5-bus ring distribution test system and the 33-bus IEEE radial distribution system.

               	   	  Internet of Things (IoT) data analytics is underpinning numerous applications, however, the task is still challenging predominantly due to heterogeneous IoT data streams, unreliable networks, and ever increasing size of the data. In this context, we propose a two-layer architecture for analyzing IoT data. The first layer provides a generic interface using a service oriented gateway to ingest data from multiple interfaces and IoT systems, store it in a scalable manner and analyze it in real-time to extract high-level events; whereas second layer is responsible for probabilistic fusion of these high-level events. In the second layer, we extend state-of-the-art event processing using Bayesian networks in order to take uncertainty into account while detecting complex events. We implement our proposed solution using open source components optimized for large-scale applications. We demonstrate our solution on real-world use-case in the domain of intelligent transportation system where we analyzed traffic, weather, and social media data streams from Madrid city in order to predict probability of congestion in real-time. The performance of the system is evaluated qualitatively using a web-interface where traffic administrators can provide the feedback about the quality of predictions and quantitatively using F-measure with an accuracy of over 80%.

               	   	  Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have been deployed to monitor network activity and to protect systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices from attacks (or intrusions). The problem with these systems is that they generate a huge amount of inappropriate false alarms whenever abnormal activities are detected and they are not too flexible for a complex environment. The high-level rate of the generated false alarms reduces the performance of IDS against cyber-attacks and makes the tasks of the security analyst particularly difficult and the management of intrusion detection process computationally expensive. We study here one of the challenging aspects of computer and network security and we propose to build a detection model for both known and unknown intrusions (or anomaly detection) via a novel nonparametric Bayesian model. The design of our framework can be extended easily to be adequate for IoT technology and notably for intelligent smart city web-based applications. In our method, we learn the patterns of the activities (both normal and anomalous) through a Bayesian-based MCMC inference for infinite bounded generalized Gaussian mixture models. Contrary to classic clustering methods, our approach does not need to specify the number of clusters, takes into consideration the uncertainty via the introduction of prior knowledge for the parameters of the model, and permits to solve problems related to over- and under-fitting. In order to get better clustering performance, feature weights, model's parameters, and the number of clusters are estimated simultaneously and automatically. The developed approach was evaluated using popular data sets. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in detecting various attacks.

               	   	Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are composed of computing devices interacting with physical systems. Model-based design is a powerful methodology in CPS design in the implementation of control systems. For instance, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is typically implemented in CPS applications, e.g., in path tracking of autonomous vehicles. MPC deploys a model to estimate the behavior of the physical system at future time instants for a specific time horizon. Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) are the most commonly used models to emulate the behavior of continuous-time (non-)linear dynamical systems. A complex physical model may comprise thousands of ODEs which pose scalability, performance and power consumption challenges. One approach to address these model complexity challenges are frameworks that automate the development of model-to-model transformation. In this paper, we introduce a model generation framework to transform ODE models of a physical system to Hybrid Harmonic Equivalent State (HES) Machine model equivalents. Moreover, tuning parameters are introduced to reconfigure the model and adjust its accuracy from coarse-grained time critical situations to fine-grained scenarios in which safety is paramount. Machine learning techniques are applied to adopt the model to run-time applications. We conduct experiments on a closed-loop MPC for path tracking using the vehicle dynamics model. We analyze the performance of the MPC when applying our Hybrid HES Machine model. The performance of our proposed model is compared with state-of-the-art ODE-based models, in terms of execution time and model accuracy. Our experimental results show a 32% reduction in MPC return time for 0.8% loss in model accuracy.

               	   	We study the problem of checking weighted CTL properties for weighted Kripke structures in presence of imprecise weights. We consider two extensions of the notion of weighted Kripke structures, namely (i) parametric weighted Kripke structures, having transitions weights modelled as affine maps over a set of parameters and, (ii) weight-uncertain Kripke structures, having transition labelled by real-valued random variables as opposed to precise real valued weights.
										We address this problem by using extended parametric dependency graphs, a symbolic extension of dependency graphs by Liu and Smolka. Experiments performed with a prototype tool implementation show that our approach outperforms by orders of magnitude an adaptation of a state-of-the-art tool for WKSs.

               	   	Conventionally, the exposure regarding knowledge of the inter vehicle link duration is a significant parameter in Vehicular Networks to estimate the delay during the failure of a specific link during the transmission. However, the mobility and dynamics of the nodes is considerably higher in a smart city than on highways and thus could emerge a complex random pattern for the investigation of the link duration, referring all sorts of uncertain conditions. There are existing link duration estimation models, which perform linear operations under linear relationships without imprecise conditions. Anticipating, the requirement to tackle the uncertain conditions in Vehicular Networks, this paper presents a hybrid neural network-driven mobility prediction model. The proposed hybrid neural network comprises a Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann machine (FCBM), which allows the random patterns of several vehicles in a single time stamp to be learned. The several dynamic parameters, which may make the contexts of Vehicular Networks uncertain, could be vehicle speed at the moment of prediction, the number of leading vehicles, the average speed of the leading vehicle, the distance to the subsequent intersection of traffic roadways and the number of lanes in a road segment. In this paper, a novel method of hybrid intelligence is initiated to tackle such uncertainty. Here, the Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine (FCBM) is a stochastic graph model that can learn joint probability distribution over its visible units (say n) and hidden feature units (say m). It is evident that there must be a prime driving parameter of the holistic network, which will monitor the interconnection of weights and biases of the Vehicular Network for all these features. The highlight of this paper is that the prime driving parameter to control the learning process should be a fuzzy number, as fuzzy logic is used to represent the vague and uncertain parameters. Therefore, if uncertainty exists due to the random patterns caused by vehicle mobility, the proposed Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine could remove the noise from the data representation. Thus, the proposed model will be able to predict robustly the mobility in VANET, referring any instance of link failure under Vehicular Network paradigm.

                           Design decisions made during early development stages of self-adaptive systems tend to have a
                           significant impact upon system properties at run time (e.g., safety, QoS). However,
                           understanding the implications of these decisions a priori is difficult due to the different
                           types and degrees of uncertainty that affect such systems (e.g., simplifying assumptions,
                           human-in-the-loop). To provide some assurances about self-adaptive system designs, evidence
                           can be gathered from activities such as simulations and prototyping, but these demand a
                           significant effort and do not provide a systematic way of dealing with uncertainty. In this
                           chapter, we describe an approach based on model checking of stochastic multiplayer games
                           (SMGs) that enables developers to approximate the behavioral envelope of a self-adaptive
                           system by analyzing best- and worst-case scenarios of alternative designs for self-adaptation
                           mechanisms. Compared to other sources of evidence, such as simulations or prototypes, our
                           approach is purely declarative and hence has the potential of providing developers with a
                           preliminary understanding of adaptation behavior with less effort, and without the need to
                           have any specific adaptation algorithms or infrastructure in place. We illustrate our
                           approach by showing how it can be used to mitigate different types of uncertainty in contexts
                           such as self-protecting systems, proactive latency-aware adaptation, and human-in-the-loop
                           adaptation.

                           properties is still an open problem. Tools and techniques to inform engineers about
                           poorly-understood design spaces in the presence of uncertainty are needed. To tackle this
                           problem, we propose an approach that combines synthesis of spaces of system design
                           alternatives from formal specifications of architectural styles with probabilistic formal
                           verification. The main contribution of this paper is a formal framework for
                           specification-driven synthesis and analysis of design spaces that provides formal guarantees
                           about the correctness of system behaviors and satisfies quantitative properties (e.g.,
                           defined over system qualities) subject to uncertainty, which is factored as a first-class
                           entity.

                           balance among multiple quality attributes is an open problem. Providing guarantees about the

                           Tools and techniques to inform engineers about poorly-understood design spaces in the
                           presence of uncertainty are needed, so that engineers can explore the design space,
                           especially when tradeoffs are crucial. To tackle this problem, we describe an approach that
                           combines synthesis of spaces of system design alternatives from formal specifications of
                           architectural styles with probabilistic formal verification. The main contribution of this

                           service-based adaptive system and a mobile robotics architecture. Our results show how the

                           simulation and dynamic analysis that can only provide estimates about average case
                           probabilistic properties.

                           Self-Adaptive systems are expected to adapt to unanticipated run-time events using imperfect
                           information about their environment. This entails handling the effects of uncertainties in
                           decision-making, which are not always considered as a first-class concern. This paper
                           contributes a formal analysis technique that explicitly considers uncertainty in sensing when
                           reasoning about the best way to adapt, possibly executing uncertainty reduction operations to
                           improve system utility. We illustrate our approach on a Denial of Service (DoS) attack
                           scenario and present some preliminary results that show the benefits of uncertainty-aware
                           decision-making with respect to using an uncertainty-ignorant approach.

                              As software applications become highly interconnected in dynamically provisioned platforms, they form the so-called systems-of-systems. Therefore, a key issue that arises in such environments is whether specific requirements are violated, when these applications interact in new unforeseen ways as new resources or system components are dynamically provisioned. Such environments require the continuous use of frameworks for assessing compliance against specific mission critical system requirements. Such frameworks should be able to (a) handle large requirements models, (b) assess system compliance repeatedly and frequently using events from possibly high velocity and high frequency data streams, and (c) use models that can reflect the vagueness that inherently exists in big data event collection and in modeling dependencies between components of complex and dynamically re-configured systems. In this paper, we introduce a framework for run time reasoning over medium and large-scale fuzzy goal models, and we propose a process which allows for the parallel evaluation of such models. The approach has been evaluated for time and space performance on large goal models, exhibiting that in a simulation environment, the parallel reasoning process offers significant performance improvement over a sequential one.                </td>

                     Control-system robustness verification with respect to implementation aspects lacks automated verification approaches for checking stability and performance of uncertain control systems, when considering finite word-length (FWL) effects. Here we describe and evaluate novel verification procedures for digital systems with uncertainties, based on software model checking and satisfiability modulo theories, named as DSVerifier v2.0, which is able to check robust stability of closed-loop control systems with respect to FWL effects. In particular, we describe our verification algorithms to check for limit-cycle oscillations (LCOs), output quantization error, and robust non-fragile stability on common closed-loop associations of digital control systems (i.e., series and feedback). DSVerifier v2.0 model checks new properties of closed-loop systems (e.g., LCO), including stability and output quantization error for uncertain plant models, and considers unknown parameters and FWL effects. Experimental results over a large set of benchmarks show that 35%, 34%, and 41% of success can be reached for stability, LCO, and output quantization error verification procedures, respectively, for a set of 396 closed-loop control system implementations and realizations.                </td>

                     This paper is concerned with the security control problem for a class of Markov jump systems subject to false data injection attack and incomplete transition rates. An on-line estimation strategy is provided for the time-variant and unknown cyber-attack modes. And then, an adaptive sliding mode controller is synthesized with different robust terms for different modes to guarantee the reachability of the specified sliding surface. Moreover, the sufficient conditions for the stability of the closed-loop systems are derived. Finally, it is shown from simulation results that the effect of both false data injection attack and incomplete TRs can be effectively attenuated by the present adaptive SMC method.                </td>

                           Modern automotive vehicles represent one category of CPS (Cyber-Physical Systems) that are inherently time- and safety-critical. To justify the actions for quality-of-service adaptation and safety assurance, it is fundamental to perceive the uncertainties of system components in operation, which are caused by emergent properties, design or operation anomalies. From an industrial point of view, a further challenge is related to the usages of generic purpose COTS (Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) components, which are separately developed and evolved, often not sufficiently verified and validated for specific automotive contexts. While introducing additional uncertainties in regard to the overall system performance and safety, the adoption of COTS components constitutes a necessary means for effective product evolution and innovation. Accordingly, we propose in this paper a novel approach that aims to enable advanced operation monitoring and self-assessment in regard to operational uncertainties and thereby automated performance and safety awareness. The emphasis is on the integration of several modeling technologies, including the domain-specific modeling framework EAST-ADL, the A-G contract theory and Hidden Markov Model (HMM). In particular, we also present some initial concepts in regard to the usage performance and safety awareness for quality-of-service adaptation and dynamic risk mitigation.                </td>

                    Trajectory generation is at the heart of an autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Given a navigation context, the UAV has to conceive a trajectory that fulfills its mission goal while avoiding collisions with obstacles and surrounding traffic. This intended trajectory is an idealization of the various actual physical trajectories that the UAV may perform during flight. The validation of actual physical trajectories with respect to their intended counterparts is challenging due to the interaction over time of several uncontrolled factors such as the environmental conditions, measurement errors and the cyber-physical components of the UAV. For this reason, the most common validation technique for trajectory generators is flight simulation, which is not exhaustive and thus cannot prove the actual absence of collisions.
        
                    This paper presents a preliminary formal framework to reason about the safety of UAV trajectories with respect to static-obstacle collision avoidance taking account of the uncertainties derived from uncontrolled factors. The proposed framework was formally verified in a mechanical theorem prover. Its application as an oracle for black-box testing validation of trajectory generators is also proposed. Such testing strategy would allow the safety evaluation of trajectories while removing the need for simulation procedures, thus reducing the cost of the validation process.

               	   	This article is a tutorial on how to achieve software evolution and adaptation in a dependable manner, by systematically applying formal modelling and verification. It shows how software can be designed upfront to tolerate different sources of uncertainty that cause continuous future changes. If possible changes can be predicted, and their occurrence can be detected, it is possible to design the software to be self-adaptable. Otherwise, continuous evolution has to be supported and continuous flow into operation has to be ensured. In cases where systems are designed to be continuously running, it is necessary to support safe continuous software deployment that guarantees correct operation in the presence of dynamic reconfigurations. The approaches we survey here have been mainly developed in the context of the SMScom project, funded by the European Commission –Programme IDEAS-ERC (http://erc-smscom.dei.polimi.it/.) – and lead by the author. It is argued that these approaches fit well the current agile methods for development and operations that are popularized as DevOps.

                            This paper presents initial results towards a realizable framework for the safety critical controlled invariance of cyber-physical systems. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a control barrier function based methodology which can be used to enforce set invariance on systems in the presence of non-linear disturbances and uncertainty. The first part of this work is a review of the current methods available for finding viable sets and how they are linked to practical choices regarding safety. Their limitations and directions towards improvements when it comes to handling model uncertainty are also highlighted. The second part of this work is the formulation of a condition which can guarantee set invariance in the presence of generic uncertain in the dynamics. An associated optimization problem to enforce that condition is proposed and a method to convexify the problem and make it solvable in real-time is formally presented. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is illustrated experimentally on a two-wheeled inverted pendulum.

							Medical cyber-physical systems, such as the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), require evaluation of safety and efficacy in the context of a patient population in a clinical trial. Advances in computer modeling and simulation allow for generation of a simulated cohort or virtual cohort which mimics a patient population and can be used as a source of prior information. A major obstacle to acceptance of simulation results as a source of prior information is the lack of a framework for explicitly modeling sources of uncertainty in simulation results and quantifying the effect on trial outcomes.In this work, we formulate the Computer-Aided Clinical Trial (CACT) within a Bayesian statistical framework allowing explicit modeling of assumptions and utilization of simulation results at all stages of a clinical trial. To quantify the robustness of the CACT outcome with respect to a simulation assumption, we define δ-robustness as the minimum perturbation of the base prior distribution resulting in a change of the CACT outcome and provide a method to estimate the δ-robustness.We demonstrate the utility of the framework and how the results of δ-robustness evaluation can be utilized at various stages of a clinical trial through an application to the Rhythm ID Goes Head-to-head Trial (RIGHT), which was a comparative evaluation of the safety and efficacy of specific software algorithms across different implantable cardiac devices. Finally, we introduce a hardware interface that allows for direct interaction with the physical device in order to validate and confirm the results of a CACT for implantable cardiac devices.

							The use of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and devices is on a sharp rise with the help of infrastructures like 5G cellular networks. However, with this swift expansion come major challenges such as management of the vast data collected by these IoT devices. In the paper, we propose a method which takes advantage of fuzzy similarity to significantly simplify the big data analysis and management for human operators and machines. A use case in the area of smart buildings was utilized to illustrate its potential application. A comparison is made between the ideal situation and the data collected from an office room. The considered environmental factors in this research are temperature, humidity, and workplace lighting and then the collected data was utilized to make triangular fuzzy numbers and after that, we compare them with an efficient fuzzy similarity measure. In addition to data summarization and abstraction, this method also protects the main information from inaccuracy. The advantage of the fuzzy controlling system is its aptitude to deal with nonlinearities and uncertainties.

							Autonomous vehicles have found wide-ranging adoption in aerospace, terrestrial as well as marine use. These systems often operate in uncertain environments and in the presence of noisy sensors, and use machine learning and statistical sensor fusion algorithms to form an internal model of the world that is inherently probabilistic. Autonomous vehicles need to operate using this uncertain world-model, and hence, their correctness cannot be deterministically specified. Even once probabilistic correctness is specified, proving that an autonomous vehicle will operate correctly is a challenging problem. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a correct-by-synthesis approach to autonomous vehicle control. We propose a probabilistic extension of temporal logic, named Chance Constrained Temporal Logic (C2TL), that can be used to specify correctness requirements in presence of uncertainty. C2TL extends temporal logic by including chance constraints as predicates in the formula which allows modeling of perception uncertainty while retaining its ease of reasoning. We present a novel automated synthesis technique that compiles C2TL specification into mixed integer constraints, and uses second-order (quadratic) cone programming to synthesize optimal control of autonomous vehicles subject to the C2TL specification. We also present a risk distribution approach that enables synthesis of plans with lower cost without increasing the overall risk. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a diverse set of illustrative examples.

						When creating the Internet of Things and Smart Machines, the RULES ENGINE pattern is developed. The tasks that Rules Engine solves in real time are characterized by large amounts of data from various sensors. To account for uncertainty, a new model of Smart Rules Engine is proposed with a two-step inference engine, including an engine of abstraction from data. A model based on quantitative, definitive and generalization type of abstraction is considered. It is shown that the proposed model solves the problem of the bridge between natural language, as a carrier of the concept's meaning, and data from sensors, as carriers of the perception. A model for presenting a prototype is given in which incomplete knowledge, expert's uncertainty in the definition of the concept and aging of data are taken into account. The prototype and data model representation and the abstraction engine are built based on fuzzy L-R numbers and arithmetic operations on them. The preliminary step of abstraction from the data, besides taking into account the uncertainty of a different nature, significantly reduces the dimension of the fuzzy inference space. A comparison of the two-step fuzzy inference engine with the traditional inference engine Fuzzy Logic System Type-1 is given using the example of a wheeled robot making the decision to safely cross an unregulated crossroad.

						Program variables used in robotic and cyber-physical systems often have implicit physical units that cannot be determined from their variable types. Inferring an abstract physical unit type for variables and checking their physical unit type consistency is of particular importance for validating the correctness of such systems. For instance, a variable with the unit of ‘meter’ should not be assigned to another variable with the unit of ‘degree-per-second’. Existing solutions have various limitations such as requiring developers to annotate variables with physical units and only handling variables that are directly or transitively used in popular robotic libraries with known physical unit information. We observe that there are a lot of physical unit hints in these softwares such as variable names and specific forms of expressions. These hints have uncertainty as developers may not respect conventions. We propose to model them with probability distributions and conduct probabilistic inference. At the end, our technique produces a unit distribution for each variable. Unit inconsistencies can then be detected using the highly probable unit assignments. Experimental results on 30 programs show that our technique can infer units for 159.3% more variables compared to the state-of-the-art with more than 88.7% true positives, and inconsistencies detection on 90 programs shows that our technique reports 103.3% more inconsistencies with 85.3% true positives.

               	   		Systems based on the concept of 'Internet of Things' (IoT) are known for multi-tiered architecture, variety and a great number of energy constrained 'things', the influence of new types of attacks, the incompleteness and ambiguity of their parameters. For these reasons, risk management in IoT could be improved by application of fuzzy data processing. The paper considers the main approaches to the construction of intelligent methods and algorithms of information security risk assessment and management for IoT. Mathematical models for security risk assessment in IoT are proposed and investigated. In relation to the concept of multi-agent network control, the Mamdani fuzzy inference procedures for risk assessment and management are developed. Procedures for fuzzy clustering, classification and ranking of security threats are outlined. The experimental results show high stability of the developed security risks management algorithms to uncertainties of input variables.

               	   		Medical cyber-physical systems (MCPS) combine independent devices at runtime in order to render new patient monitoring/control functionalities, such as physiological closed loops for controlling drug infusion and optimization of alarms. MCPS and their relevant system contexts are highly variable, which detrimentally affects the application of established safety assurance methodologies. In this paper, we introduce an approach based on dynamic risk assessment and control for MCPS. During runtime, information regarding the safety properties of the constituent systems, relevant information about the patient’s characteristics, as well as other relevant context information is utilized to dynamically and continuously optimize the system performance while guaranteeing an acceptable level of safety. We evaluated our approach by means of a patient-controlled analgesia proof-of-concept simulation and sensitivity analysis.

                                Crowded public venues are significantly under risks and uncertainties caused by fire and overcrowding hazards. For this purpose, Situational Awareness (SiA) -that is a mechanism to know what is going on around- can facilitate the automatic (or human involved) critical decision making and executing processes. Considering the dynamic and uncertain essence of crowd and hazard behavior in an emergency, executing the optimum evacuation plan is highly complex and needs strong models. In this paper, taking in input a model of the Cyber-Physical Space under SiA monitoring, we define an architectural-map-based Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to describe and predict crowd and hazard behavior. Then, in order to minimize the total evacuation time, the authors present a quickest flow model for consecutive time intervals. Overall, the paper shows the importance of hazard quiddity, and crowd behavior on the evacuation efficiency in emergency situations. The approach is demonstrated through a small (but concrete) running example.

                                This paper develops a model-based framework for the quantification and propagation of multiple uncertainty sources affecting the performance of a smart system. A smart system, in general, performs sensing, control and actuation for proper functioning of a physical subsystem (also referred to as a plant). With strong feedback coupling between several subsystems, the uncertainty in the quantities of interest (QoI) amplifies over time. The coupling in a generic smart system occurs at two levels: (1) coupling between individual subsystems (plant, cyber, actuation, sensors), and (2) coupling between nodes in a distributed computational subsystem. In this paper, a coupled smart system is decoupled and considered as a feed-forward system over time and modeled using a two-level Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN), one at each level of coupling (between subsystems and between nodes). A DBN can aggregate uncertainty from multiple sources within a time step and across time steps. The DBN associated with a smart system can be learned using available system models, physics models and data. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for the design of a smart indoor heating system (identification of sensors and a wireless network) within cost constraints that enables room-by-room temperature control. We observe that sensor uncertainty has a higher impact on the performance of the heating system compared to the uncertainty in the wireless network.

                                Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are expected to continuously monitor the physical components to autonomously calculate appropriate runtime reactions to deal with the uncertain environmental conditions. Self-adaptation, as a promising concept to fulfill a set of provable rules, majorly needs runtime quantitative verification (RQV). Taking a few probabilistic variables into account to represent the uncertainties, the system configuration will be extremely large. Thus, efficient approaches are needed to reduce the model state-space, preferably with certain bounds on the approximation error. In this paper, we propose an approximation framework to efficiently approximate the entire model of a self-adaptive system. We split up the large model into strongly-connected components (SCCs), apply the approximation algorithm separately on each SCC, and integrate the result of each part using a centralized algorithm. Due to a number of changes in probabilistic variables, it is not possible to use static models. Addressing this issue, we have deployed parametric Markov decision process. In order to apply approximation on the model, the notion of ε-approximate probabilistic bisimulation is utilized that introduces the approximation level ε. We show that our approximation framework offers a certain error bound on each level of approximation. Then, we denote that the approximation framework is appropriate to be applied in decision-making process of self-adaptive systems where the models are relatively large. The results reveal that we can achieve up to 50% size reduction in the approximate model while maintaining the accuracy about 95%. In addition, we discuss about the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy of our approximation framework.

                                The enhancement in the number of sensors deployed to collect every single bit of information to develop intelligent applications is potentially growing in today's Internet of Things paradigm. The acquired data from sensors is to be inferred into meaningful information for decision making to address real world situations. Context information modeling and reasoning is one of the investigative research concern in the design and development of smart health care applications. As the accessed information is inherently imperfect, we propose a computational intelligence technique to analyze uncertainty associated with sensor data. In this paper, we propose Context Information, Observation and Belief (C-IOB) model from the perspective of in-hospital environment and the analysis is based on Bayesian network to deal with imprecise information. The proposed model provides a relevant service based on our research findings.

                                The sharing of data and resources in Future Internet applications (Machine-to-Machine (M2M), Internet of Things (IoT), Web of People (Web2.0), Web of Data (Web3.0)) and the massive distribution of data sources introduces heterogeneity in the Quality of Information (QoI) produced. It is thus necessary to be able to evaluate the QoI at any time and to take it into account for further processing and analysis. In this paper, we present an extension of a semantic context broker which enables to handle the dual problems of trust amongst the data sources and uncertainty in the context data. This extension is based on incorporating one ontology for modeling uncertainty and one ontology for modeling trust, to an IoT ontology that the initial semantic context broker was already based upon. The resulting system has been implemented and tested successfully on real data.

               	   			Due to the uncertainty of what actual adaptations will be performed at run time, verifying adaptive systems at design time may lead to limited results or may even be infeasible. Run-time verification techniques have been proposed to cope with this uncertainty. Recently, there has been an increasing interest to use model checking (an important verification technique) at run time in order to verify the expected properties of adaptive systems. Given a system specification and expected system properties, a model checker determines whether or not the specification satisfies its properties in the presence of self-adaptation. One key concern is the generally high resource needs of model checking, which may prohibit its use on resource- and power-constrained devices, such as smart-phones or Internet-of-Things devices. To address this challenge, we introduce a cloud-based framework that delivers model checking as a service (MCaaS). MCaaS offloads computationally intensive model checking tasks to the cloud, thereby offering verification capabilities on demand. Adaptive systems running on any kind of connected device may take the advantages of model checking at run time by invoking the MCaaS service. To dynamically allocate the required cloud resources (CPU and memory), we employ machine learning to estimate the resource usage of an actual model checking task at run time. As proof of concept, we implement and validate the approach for the case of probabilistic model checking, which facilitates verifying typical properties such as reliability.

                                We increasingly live in cyber-physical spaces: spaces that are both physical and digital, and where the two aspects are intertwined. Cyber-physical spaces may exhibit a range of behaviors, from smart control of heating, ventilation, and light to visionary multi-functional living spaces that can be spatially re-organized in a dynamic way. In contrast to traditional physical environments, cyber-physical spaces often exhibit dynamic behaviors: they can change over time and react to changes occurring in space. Current design of spaces, however, does not normally accommodate the cyber aspects of modern spatial environments and does not capture their dynamic behavior. Spatial design, although done with CAD tools and following certain international processes and standards, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM), largely produces syntactic descriptions of spaces which lack dynamic semantics. As a consequence, designs cannot be automatically (and formally) analyzed with respect to various requirements emerging from dynamic cyber-physical spaces; safety, security or reliability requirements being typical examples of this. This paper will show an avenue for research which can be characterized as rethinking the design of spatial environments, i.e., dynamic cyber-physical spaces, from a software engineering perspective. We outline our approach where formally analyzable models may be automatically extracted from BIM depending on the analysis required, and then checked against formally specified requirements, both regarding static and dynamic properties of the design, prior to the construction phase (at design time). To realize automated operational management, these models can also be used during operation to continuously check satisfaction of the requirements when changes occur, and possibly enforce their satisfaction through self-adaptive strategies (at run-time).

                                One of the main purposes of the Internet of Things (IoT) systems is to provide information on the observed physical system and to notify when a certain observed complex event occurs in the system. The biggest challenge of the IoT systems is that the systems collect a massive amount of uncertain data from diverse IoT devices, where the devices are connected through the internet. In addition to that, some events are inferred from other events and uncertainty is propagated from parent events to the inferred events, which additionally contributes to overall system uncertainty. The observed complex events are a complex relationship of primitive events that are produced by IoT devices and collected in IoT system. There were a couple of attempts to quantify the system uncertainty by estimating the likelihood of the occurrence of events of interest while taking into account the uncertain data and uncertain parameters of the model of the physical system with rule-based complex event processing and/or Bayesian network. These methods were implemented as stand-alone software solutions that are unable to scale under heavy loads of incoming events. This paper proposes a micro-service based notification methodology that uses complex event recognition to handle the IoT system uncertainty.

                                With the rapid advances in sensing and digital technologies, cyber-physical systems are regarded as the most viable platforms for improving building design and management. Researchers investigated the possibility of integrating energy management systems with cyber-physical systems to form energy-cyber-physical systems in order to promote building energy management. However, minimizing energy consumption while fulfilling building functions for energy-cyber-physical systems is challenging due to the dynamics of building occupants. As occupant behavior is a major source of uncertainty for energy management, ignoring it often results in both energy waste caused by overheating and overcooling as well as discomfort due to insufficient thermal and ventilation services. To mitigate such uncertainties, this study proposes an occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical system that incorporates WiFi probe-based occupancy detection. The proposed framework utilizes ensemble classification algorithms to extract three forms of occupancy information. It creates a data interface to link energy management systems and cyber-physical systems and allows for automated occupancy detection and interpretation by assembling multiple weak classifiers for WiFi signals. A validation experiment in a large office room was conducted to examine the performance of the proposed occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical systems. The experiment and simulation results suggest that, with a proper classifier and occupancy data type, the proposed model can potentially save about 26.4% of energy consumption in cooling and ventilation demands.

                               Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is widely used to track and trace objects in supply chain management. However, massive uncertain data produced by RFID readers are not suitable for directly use in RFID applications. Following our thorough analysis of key features of RFID objects, this paper proposes a new framework for effectively and efficiently processing uncertain RFID data, and supporting a variety of queries for tracking and tracing RFID objects. In particular, we propose an adaptive cleaning method by adjusting size of smoothing window according to various rates of uncertain data, employing different strategies to process uncertain readings, and distinguishing different types of uncertain data according to their appearing positions. We propose a comprehensive data model, which is suitable for a wide range of application scenarios. In addition, a path coding scheme is proposed to significantly compress massive data by aggregating the path sequences, the positions and the time intervals. Experimental evaluations show that our approach is effective and efficient in terms of the compression and traceability queries.

                              Since Internet of Things (IoT) applications are deployed within open physical environments, their executions suffer from a wide spectrum of uncertain factors (e.g., network delay, sensor inputs). Although ThingML is a promising IoT modeling and specification language which enables the fast development of resource-constrained IoT applications, it lacks the capability to model such uncertainties and quantify their effects. Consequently, within uncertain environments the quality and performance of IoT applications generated from ThingML designs cannot be guaranteed. To explore the overall runtime performance variations caused by environmental uncertainties, this paper proposes a quantitative uncertainty evaluation framework for ThingML-based IoT designs. By adopting network of priced timed automata as the model of computation and statistical model checking as the evaluation engine, our approach can model uncertainties caused by external environments as well as support various kinds of performance queries on the extended ThingML designs. Experimental results of two comprehensive case studies demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

                              In complex cyber-physical system operations, fault detection needs to be performed using limited state information for practicality and privacy concerns. While a well-designed observation can distinguish a faulty behavior from the normal behavior, it can also represent the action of hiding some of the state information or discrete mode switchings. In this paper, we present a method for constructing the observation maps in the form of metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas that can be formally proven to detect fault in a switched system, while preserving certain privacy conditions. We provide a theoretical framework of robust temporal logic inference for classification of switched system trajectories with spatial and temporal uncertainties. We simulate finitely many nominal trajectories and use the robust neighborhoods around the simulated trajectories to cover the infinite trajectories that constitute the system behavior. Thus, the designed observation maps with the inferred MTL formulas can detect fault and preserve privacy in a provably correct fashion. Our approach is implemented on the simulation model of a smart building testbed to detect thermal leakage in the room, while preserving multiple privacy conditions of the room occupancy.

                             Due to the ability to handle uncertain nonlinear hybrid systems, barrier certificate based method has been widely used in safety verification problem. In this paper, an efficient framework, combining sum of squares programming with interval analysis, is proposed to generate barrier certificates for uncertain nonlinear hybrid systems. It utilizes the feature of bounded uncertainties to get a deterministic hybrid system, whose barrier certificates can be efficiently computed using sum of squares programming. The computed barrier certificates are then chosen as candidate barrier certificates for the original uncertain hybrid system, and need to be checked the satisfaction of the associated barrier certificate conditions, via an interval analysis based method. As an application, our approach is used to verify safety properties of non-polynomial hybrid systems. Some experimental results are given to show the efficiency of our approach.

                            Context
														Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), when deployed for operation, are inherently prone to uncertainty. Considering their applications in critical domains (e.g., healthcare), it is important that such CPSs are tested sufficiently, with the explicit consideration of uncertainty. Model-based testing (MBT) involves creating test ready models capturing the expected behavior of a CPS and its operating environment. These test ready models are then used for generating executable test cases. It is, therefore, necessary to develop methods that can continuously evolve, based on real operational data collected during the operation of CPSs, test ready models and uncertainty captured in them, all together termed as Belief Test Ready Models (BMs)
														Objective
														Our objective is to propose a model evolution framework that can interactively improve the quality of BMs, based on operational data. Such BMs are developed by one or more test modelers (belief agents) with their assumptions about the expected behavior of a CPS, its expected physical environment, and potential future deployments. Thus, these models explicitly contain subjective uncertainty of the test modelers.
														Method
														We propose a framework (named as UncerTolve) for interactively evolving BMs (specified with extended UML notations) of CPSs with subjective uncertainty developed by test modelers. The key inputs of UncerTolve include initial BMs of CPSs with known subjective uncertainty and real data collected from the operation of CPSs. UncerTolve has three key features: 1) Validating the syntactic correctness and conformance of BMs against real operational data via model execution, 2) Evolving objective uncertainty measurements of BMs via model execution, and 3) Evolving state invariants (modeling test oracles) and guards of transitions (modeling constraints for test data generation) of BMs with a machine learning technique.
														Results
														As a proof-of-concept, we evaluated UncerTolve with one industrial CPS case study, i.e., GeoSports from the healthcare domain. Using UncerTolve, we managed to evolve 51% of belief elements, 18% of states, and 21% of transitions as compared to the initial BM developed in an industrial setting.
														Conclusion
														UncerTolve can successfully evolve model elements of the initial BM, in addition to objective uncertainty measurements using real operational data. The evolved model can be used to generate additional test cases covering evolved model elements and objective uncertainty. These additional test cases can be used to test the current and future deployments of a CPS to ensure that it will handle uncertainty gracefully during its operations.

                            Adaptive systems are expected to adapt to unanticipated run-time events using imperfect information about themselves, their environment, and goals. This entails handling the effects of uncertainties in decision-making, which are not always considered as a first-class concern. This paper contributes a formal analysis technique that explicitly considers uncertainty in sensing when reasoning about the best way to adapt, together with uncertainty reduction mechanisms to improve system utility. We illustrate our approach on a Denial of Service (DoS) attack scenario and present results that demonstrate the benefits of uncertainty-aware decision-making in comparison to using an uncertainty-ignorant approach, both in the presence and absence of uncertainty reduction mechanisms.

               	   	  Active automata learning algorithms have gained increasing importance in the field of model-based system verification. For some classes of systems - especially deterministic systems, like Mealy machines, a variety of learning algorithm implementations is readily available. In this paper, we apply this technique to a measurement device from the automotive industry in order to systematically test its behaviour. However, our system under learning shows sparse non-deterministic behaviour, preventing the direct application of the available learning tools.
											We propose an implementation of the active automata learning framework which masks this non-determinism. We repeat a previous model-based testing experiment with faulty devices and show that we can detect all injected faults. Most importantly, our technique was also able to find unknown bugs.

               	   	 Multi-objective uncertainty-wise test case minimization focuses on selecting a minimum number of test cases to execute out of all available ones while maximizing effectiveness (e.g., coverage), minimizing cost (e.g., time to execute test cases), and at the same time optimizing uncertainty-related objectives. In our previous unpublished work, we developed four uncertainty-wise test case minimization strategies relying on Uncertainty Theory and multi-objective search (NSGA-II with default settings), which were evaluated with one real Cyber-Physical System (CPS) with inherent uncertainty. However, a fundamental question to answer is whether these default settings of NSGA-II are good enough to provide optimized solutions. In this direction, we report one of the preliminary empirical evaluations, where we performed an experiment with three different mutation operators and three crossover operators, i.e., in total nine combinations with NSGA-II for the four uncertainty-wise test case minimization strategies using a real CPS case study. Results show that the Blend Alpha crossover operator together with the polynomial mutation operator permits NSGA-II achieving the best performance for solving our uncertainty-wise test minimization problems.

               	   	As compared with classical software/system testing, uncertainty-wise testing explicitly addresses known uncertainty about the behavior of a System Under Test (SUT), its operating environment, and interactions between the SUT and its operational environment, across all testing phases, including test design, test generation, test optimization, and test execution, with the aim to mainly achieve the following two goals. First, uncertainty-wise testing aims to ensure that the SUT deals with known uncertainty adequately. Second, uncertainty-wise testing should be also capable of learning new (previously unknown) uncertainties such that the SUT's implementation can be improved to guard against newly learned uncertainties during its operation. The necessity to integrate uncertainty in testing is becoming imperative because of the emergence of new types of intelligent and communicating software-based systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Intrinsically, such systems are exposed to uncertainty because of their interactions with highly indeterminate physical environments. In this chapter, we provide our understanding and experience of uncertainty-wise testing from the aspects of uncertainty-wise model-based testing, uncertainty-wise modeling and evolution of test ready models, and uncertainty-wise multiobjective test optimization, in the context of testing CPSs under uncertainty. Furthermore, we present our vision about this new testing paradigm and its plausible future research directions.

               	   	For an effective use of a robotic prosthetic, smooth transition between the states of this human-in-the-loop cyber-physical system (or autonomous operation) is crucial. In order to achieve that, taking into account the uncertainties in the robotic system may be as significant as anticipating the human intent. In this study, we present two risk measures associated with a simple grasping task based on the pre-grasp position and orientation of the robotic hand, and analyze them by using a model of a dexterous mechatronic prosthetic arm to simulate a simple grasping task. Moreover, we develop a hybrid position and force grasp controller and use a grasp quality metric to assess the grasps. 34 simulations with different pre-grasp poses were performed to investigate the relationship between the grasp quality and the risk measures as well as the sensitivity of the grasp quality to the pre-grasp position of the hand. Results show that the proposed risk metrics and the pre-grasp position correlate with the grasp quality, yet they are not sufficient to predict the outcome.

               	   	Conventionally, the exposure regarding knowledge of the inter vehicle link duration is a significant parameter in Vehicular Networks to estimate the delay during the failure of a specific link during the transmission. However, the mobility and dynamics of the nodes is considerably higher in a smart city than on highways and thus could emerge a complex random pattern for the investigation of the link duration, referring all sorts of uncertain conditions. There are existing link duration estimation models, which perform linear operations under linear relationships without imprecise conditions. Anticipating, the requirement to tackle the uncertain conditions in Vehicular Networks, this paper presents a hybrid neural network-driven mobility prediction model. The proposed hybrid neural network comprises a Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann machine (FCBM), which allows the random patterns of several vehicles in a single time stamp to be learned. The several dynamic parameters, which may make the contexts of Vehicular Networks uncertain, could be vehicle speed at the moment of prediction, the number of leading vehicles, the average speed of the leading vehicle, the distance to the subsequent intersection of traffic roadways and the number of lanes in a road segment. In this paper, a novel method of hybrid intelligence is initiated to tackle such uncertainty. Here, the Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine (FCBM) is a stochastic graph model that can learn joint probability distribution over its visible units (say n) and hidden feature units (say m). It is evident that there must be a prime driving parameter of the holistic network, which will monitor the interconnection of weights and biases of the Vehicular Network for all these features. The highlight of this paper is that the prime driving parameter to control the learning process should be a fuzzy number, as fuzzy logic is used to represent the vague and uncertain parameters. Therefore, if uncertainty exists due to the random patterns caused by vehicle mobility, the proposed Fuzzy Constrained Boltzmann Machine could remove the noise from the data representation. Thus, the proposed model will be able to predict robustly the mobility in VANET, referring any instance of link failure under Vehicular Network paradigm.

               	   			As Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical systems become more ubiquitous and an integral part of our daily lives, it is important that we are able to trust the data aggregate from such systems. However, the interpretation of trustworthiness is contextual and varies according to the risk tolerance attitude of the concerned application and varying levels of uncertainty associated with the evidence upon which trust models act. Hence, the data integrity scoring mechanisms should have provisions to adapt to varying risk attitudes and uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian inference model and a prospect theoretic framework for data integrity scoring that quantify the trustworthiness of data collected from IoT devices by a hub in the presence of an adversary manipulating data and an imperfect anomaly monitoring mechanism. The monitoring mechanism monitors the data being sent from each device and classifies the outcome as not compromised, compromised, and cannot be inferred. These outcomes are conceptualized as a multinomial hypothesis of a Bayesian inference model with three parameters which are then used for calculating a utility value on how reliable the aggregate data is. We use prospect theory inspired approach to quantify this data integrity score and evaluate trustworthiness of the aggregate data from the IoT framework. As decisions are based on how the data is fused, we propose two measuring models-one optimistic and another conservative. The proposed framework is validated using extensive simulation experiments. We show how data integrity scores vary under a variety of system factors like attack intensity and inaccurate detection.

                           Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems are usually composed of thousands of different components
                           among hardware devices and different software modules. In order to address the design of
                           these complex systems, different abstraction layers are usually defined. However, as these
                           layers are isolated, highlevel components always have uncertainty about the nature of the
                           low-level components they relate with. In particular, as low-level component identities are
                           not known by user applications, and current IoT systems are vulnerable to the injection of
                           new components and to the modification of the behavior of existing ones (adequate security
                           solutions at the network level for these problems have not been found yet), the reliability
                           of the received data is generally compromised. In this context, new mechanisms are required
                           to avoid the interactions or directly remove the malicious components relying on high-level
                           information. This paper describes a statistical framework to discover IoT components with
                           malicious behaviors, using a hybrid reputation model. On the one hand, an implicit reputation
                           definition is employed, based on the observations made by a certain IoT component and other
                           modules it relies on. On the other hand, an explicit reputation model considers a scheme of
                           recommendations and negative grades. The proposed solution is evaluated in a simulation
                           scenario by using the NS3 simulator, in order to perform an experimental validation.

                           Neural State Classification (NSC) [19] is a scalable method for the analysis of hybrid
                           systems, which consists in learning a neural network-based classifier able to detect whether
                           or not an unsafe state can be reached from a certain configuration of a hybrid system. NSC
                           has very high accuracy, yet it is prone to prediction errors that can affect system safety.
                           To overcome this limitation, we present a method, based on the theory of conformal
                           prediction, that complements NSC predictions with statistically sound estimates of prediction
                           uncertainty. This results in a principled criterion to reject potentially erroneous
                           predictions a priori, i.e., without knowing the true reachability values. Our approach is
                           highly efficient (with runtimes in the order of milliseconds) and effective, managing in our
                           experiments to successfully reject almost all the wrong NSC predictions.

                           Design decisions made during early development stages of self-adaptive systems tend to have a
                           significant impact upon system properties at run time (e.g., safety, QoS). However,
                           understanding the implications of these decisions a priori is difficult due to the different
                           types and degrees of uncertainty that affect such systems (e.g., simplifying assumptions,
                           human-in-the-loop). To provide some assurances about self-adaptive system designs, evidence
                           can be gathered from activities such as simulations and prototyping, but these demand a
                           significant effort and do not provide a systematic way of dealing with uncertainty. In this
                           chapter, we describe an approach based on model checking of stochastic multiplayer games
                           (SMGs) that enables developers to approximate the behavioral envelope of a self-adaptive
                           system by analyzing best- and worst-case scenarios of alternative designs for self-adaptation
                           mechanisms. Compared to other sources of evidence, such as simulations or prototypes, our
                           approach is purely declarative and hence has the potential of providing developers with a
                           preliminary understanding of adaptation behavior with less effort, and without the need to
                           have any specific adaptation algorithms or infrastructure in place. We illustrate our
                           approach by showing how it can be used to mitigate different types of uncertainty in contexts
                           such as self-protecting systems, proactive latency-aware adaptation, and human-in-the-loop
                           adaptation.

                           Self-Adaptive systems are expected to adapt to unanticipated run-time events using imperfect
                           information about their environment. This entails handling the effects of uncertainties in
                           decision-making, which are not always considered as a first-class concern. This paper
                           contributes a formal analysis technique that explicitly considers uncertainty in sensing when
                           reasoning about the best way to adapt, possibly executing uncertainty reduction operations to
                           improve system utility. We illustrate our approach on a Denial of Service (DoS) attack
                           scenario and present some preliminary results that show the benefits of uncertainty-aware
                           decision-making with respect to using an uncertainty-ignorant approach.

                              This keynote talk and paper intend to motivate research projects that investigate novel ways to model, analyze, and mitigate uncertainty arising in three different aspects of the cyber-physical systems. First, uncertainty about the physical environment can lead to suboptimal, and sometimes catastrophic, results as the system tries to adapt to unanticipated or poorly-understood environmental conditions. Second, uncertainty in the cyber environment can have lead to unexpected and adverse effects, including not only performance impacts (load, traffic, etc.) but also potential threats or overt attacks. Finally, uncertainty can exist with the components themselves and how they interact upon reconfiguration, including unexpected and unwanted feature interactions. Each of these sources of uncertainty can potentially be identified at different stages, respectively run time, design time, and requirements, but their mitigation might be done at the same or a different stage. Based on the related literature and our preliminary investigations, we argue that the following three overarching techniques are essential and warrant further research to provide enabling technologies to address uncertainty at all three stages: model-based development, assurance, and dynamic adaptation. Furthermore, we posit that in order to go beyond incremental improvements to current software engineering techniques, we need to leverage, extend, and integrate techniques from other disciplines.                </td>

               	   	Changing production systems and product requirements can trace their origin in volatile customer behaviour and evolving product requirements. This dynamic nature of customer requirements has been described as a constantly moving target, thus presenting a significant challenge for several aspects of product development. To deal with this constant and sometimes unpredictable product evolution, cyber physical production systems (CPPS) that employ condition monitoring, self-awareness and reconfigurability principles, have to be designed and implemented. This research contributes a CPPS design approach that proactively provides the required CPPS design knowledge. This approach aims to minimise or avoids future consequences and disruptions on the CPPS. This knowledge needs to be provided at the right time whilst not being intrusive to the production system designer’s cognitive activity. To effectively deal with the complexity of the cyber physical production system design activity with a manual method would lead to a time consuming, and complex support tool which is hard to implement, and difficult to use. The CPPS design approach has therefore been implemented in a prototype digital factory tool. This paper describes in detail the system requirements and system architecture for this tool. In order to establish the effectiveness of the proposed approach for designing cyber physical production systems, the prototype digital factory tool has been evaluated with a case study and a number of semi-structured interviews with both industrial and scientific stakeholders. The encouraging results obtained from this research evaluation have shown that such an approach for supporting the CPPS design activity makes stakeholders aware of their decision consequences and is useful in practice. This result can lead the way for the development and integration of such knowledge-based decision-making approaches within state-of-the-art digital factory and Computer Aided Engineering Design (CAED) tools.

               	   	Industry 4.0 is widely accepted in manufacturing industry since it guides a novel and promising production paradigm. A new characteristic in Industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems is that the applications of advanced intelligent machines which have communication, self-optimization and self-training behaviors. Based on this new change, this study investigates a flow-shop scheduling problem under the consideration of multiple objectives, time-dependent processing time and uncertainty. A mixed integer programming model is formulated for this problem, and a fireworks algorithm is developed where some special strategies are designed, e.g., explosion sparks procedure and selection solution procedure. Simulation experiments on a set of test problems are carried out, and the experimental results demonstrate that the model and proposed algorithm can achieve a satisfactory performance by comparing with three state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms.

                            This paper deals with the problem of optimal bidding in a day-ahead market of electricity for a power producer having joint operation of wind with photovoltaic power systems and storage of energy. Uncertainty, not only on electricity market prices, but also on wind and photovoltaic powers, has to be faced in order to achieve optimal bidding. The problem is viewed as a sort of a two-stage stochastic optimization problem formulated by mix-integer linear programming. A case study with data from the Iberian Peninsula is presented and a comparison between joint and disjoint operations is discussed, allowing concluding that the joint operation attenuates the economic impact of disjoint operation volatility.

                            This paper presents initial results towards a realizable framework for the safety critical controlled invariance of cyber-physical systems. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a control barrier function based methodology which can be used to enforce set invariance on systems in the presence of non-linear disturbances and uncertainty. The first part of this work is a review of the current methods available for finding viable sets and how they are linked to practical choices regarding safety. Their limitations and directions towards improvements when it comes to handling model uncertainty are also highlighted. The second part of this work is the formulation of a condition which can guarantee set invariance in the presence of generic uncertain in the dynamics. An associated optimization problem to enforce that condition is proposed and a method to convexify the problem and make it solvable in real-time is formally presented. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is illustrated experimentally on a two-wheeled inverted pendulum.

                        Context: Software Fuzzy Self-Adaptation (SFSA) is a fuzzy control-based software self-adaptation paradigm proposed to deal with the fuzzy uncertainty existing in self-adaptive software. However, as many software engineers lack fuzzy control knowledge, it is difficult for them to design and model this kind of fuzzy self-adaptive software (F-SAS). Therefore, efficient and effective modeling technologies and tools are needed for the SFSA framework.
                        Objective: This paper aims to identify modeling requirements of F-SAS and to provide a modeling framework to specify, design and model F-SAS systems. Such a framework can simplify modeling process of F-SAS and improve the accessibility of software engineers to the SFSA paradigm.
                        Method: This study proposes a modeling framework called Fuzzy self-Adaptation ModEling (FAME). By extending UML, FAME creates three types of modeling views. An analysis view called Fuzzy Case Diagram is created to specify the fuzzy self-adaptation goal and the realization processes of this goal. A structure view called Fuzzy Class Diagram is created to describe the fuzzy concepts and structural characteristics of F-SAS. A behavior view called Fuzzy Sequence Diagram is created to depict the dynamic behaviors of the F-SAS systems. The framework is implemented as a plug-in of Enterprise Architect.
                        Results: We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach by carrying out a subject-based empirical evaluation. The results show that FAME framework can improve modeling quality of F-SAS systems by 44.38% and shorten modeling time of F-SAS systems by 38.41% in comparison with traditional UML. Thus, FAME can considerably ease the modeling process of F-SAS systems.
                        Conclusion: FAME framework incorporates the SFSA concepts into standard UML. Therefore, it provides a direct support to model SFSA characteristics and improves the accessibility of software engineers to the SFSA paradigm. Furthermore, it behaves a good example and provides good references for modeling domain-specific software systems.

                            Smart grid is a so-called “cyber-power system” because the cyber systems (control/monitoring/protection, and communication networks) are integrated to power systems in it. The less effort has been devoted in literature to reliability evaluation based on direct cyber-power Interdependencies (DCPIs) in widespread presence of distributed generations (DGs) and charging load of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as supply side uncertainties and demand side ones. The consideration of uncertainty regarding the PHEVs in addition to other uncertain aspects inside the DCPIs is one of the most important contributions of this paper. In addition, the sensitivity analysis of reliability versus the variation of failures in power and cyber elements is essentially analyzed. The introduced method is applied to two realistic case studies. The test results infer that the DCPI-based reliability evaluation of smart grids including DGs and PHEVs is achievable through use of the proposed method. Because of using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), it is possible to extend the proposed method by integration of future uncertain and stochastic subjects without any limit. Further, the test results illustrate that the communication failures as direct network-element interdependencies (DNEI) is more important than direct element-element interdependencies (DEEI). The numerical results also imply that the risk level due to DCPIs increases due to inappropriate cyber network configurations.

                            In the current era of big data, huge volumes of a wide variety of valuable data of different veracity (e.g., uncertain data) can be easily collected and generated from a broad range of data sources (e.g., social networking sites) at a high velocity in various real-life applications. Many traditional data management and analytic approaches may not be suitable for handling the big data due to their well-known 5V’s characteristics. In this paper, we present a cognitive-based system for social network analysis. Our system supports information discovery of interesting social patterns from big uncertain social networks—which are represented in the form of key-value pairs—capturing the perceived likelihood of the linkages among the social entities in the network.

							Cyber-physical systems are often hybrid consisting of both discrete and continuous subsystems. The continuous dynamics in cyber-physical systems could be noisy and the environment in which these stochastic hybrid systems operate can also be uncertain. We focus on multimodal hybrid systems in which the switching from one mode to another is determined by a schedule and the optimal finite horizon control problem is to discover the switching schedule as well as the control inputs to be applied in each mode such that some cost metric is minimized over the given horizon. We consider discrete-time control in this paper. We present a two step approach to solve this problem with respect to convex cost objectives and probabilistic safety properties. Our approach uses a combination of sample average approximation and convex programming. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on case studies from temperature-control in buildings and motion planning.

						In recent years, expectations for large-scale wireless sensor networks have been rapidly increased due to miniaturization, cost reduction, reduction in power consumption of wireless sensor devices, and the emergence of wireless sensor network applications such as IoT (Internet Of Things). However, in addition to the uncertainty inherent in wireless sensor networks, due to the uncertainty caused by the expansion of wireless sensor networks, it is not easy to realize a highly efficient and reliable large-scale wireless sensor network. The uncertainty of wireless sensor networks is classified into three types: the uncertainty of nodes such as sensor nodes and sink nodes, the uncertainty of wireless communication links among nodes, and the uncertainty of traffic transferred over the wireless sensor network. In this paper, as a wireless communication standard, we focus on IEEE 802.15.4, which is designed for short-range wireless networks called PANs (Personal Area Networks), and analyze large-scale wireless sensor networks using fluid approximation. Specifically, IEEE 802.15.4 large-scale wireless sensor networks are analyzed by extending the modeling approach for generic CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) wireless networks. Moreover, our analysis makes it possible to probabilistically model temporal fluctuation of wireless communication ranges of nodes as network uncertainty. As a result, our analysis clarifies the effect of link uncertainty on the average message delivery delay in wireless sensor networks.

               	   		The integration of physical systems through computing and networking has become pervasive, a trend now known as cyber-physical systems (CPS). Functionality in CPS emerges from the interaction of networked computational and physical objects. System design and integration are particularly challenging because fundamentally different physical and computational design concerns intersect. The impact of these interactions is the loss of compositionality which creates tremendous challenges. The key idea in this article is to use passivity for decoupling the control design of networked systems from uncertainties such as time delays and packet loss, thus providing a fundamental simplification strategy that limits the complexity of interactions. The main contribution is the application of the approach to an experimental case study of a networked multi-robot system. We present a networked control architecture that ensures the overall system remains stable in spite of implementation uncertainties such as network delays and data dropouts, focusing on the technical details required for the implementation. We describe a prototype domain-specific modeling language and automated code generation tools for the design of networked control systems on top of passivity that facilitate effective system configuration, deployment, and testing. Finally, we present experimental evaluation results that show decoupling of interlayer interactions.

               	   	This paper systematically deals with robust consensus of uncertain linear multi-agent systems via dynamic output-feedback protocols. Agents are assumed to have identical nominal linear time-invariant dynamics but are subject to heterogeneous additive stable perturbations. Dynamic output-feedback protocols with or without controller state information exchange between neighboring controllers are studied in a unified framework. Two methods are proposed for protocol design, which need to solve an algebraic Riccati equation and some scalar/matrix inequalities. The first method characterizes some key parameters by scalar inequalities related to the nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian, which requires the diagonalizability of the Laplacian, while the second method characterizes the parameters by linear matrix inequalities, which circumvents the requirement of the diagonalizability of the Laplacian. Compared with existing results, the proposed approach can simultaneously cope with heterogeneous uncertainties and directed communication graphs. Numerical results verify the advantages of the proposed design methods.

Probabilistic optimal power flow (OPF) analysis is required to accomplish the electrical and economic operational goals. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to accelerate the computation of probabilistic OPF for large-scale smart grids through network reduction (NR). Cumulant-based method and Gram-Charlier expansion theory are used to efficiently obtain the statistics of system states. We develop a more accurate linear mapping method to compute the unknown cumulants. Our method speeds up the computation by up to 4.57X and can improve around 30% accuracy when Hessian matrix is ill-conditioned compared to the previous approach.

               	   Self-healing is becoming an essential behavior of smart Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), which enables them to recover from faults by themselves. Such behaviors make decisions autonomously at runtime and they often operate in an uncertain physical environment making testing even more challenging. To this end, we propose Fragility-Oriented Testing (FOT), which relies on model execution and reinforcement learning to cost-effectively test self-healing behaviors of CPSs in the presence of environmental uncertainty. We evaluated FOT’s performance by comparing it with a Coverage-Oriented Testing (COT) algorithm. Evaluation results show that FOT significantly outperformed COT for testing nine self-healing behaviors implemented in three case studies. On average, FOT managed to find 80% more faults than COT and for cases when both FOT and COT found the same faults, FOT took on average 50% less time than COT.

                                Detecting the anomalies timely in the condition monitoring data, which are highly relevant to the potential system faults, has become a research focus in many domains. Among the various detection methods available, the prediction-based algorithms are popular without using prior knowledge and expert labels. Additionally, these methods can take the time-ordered specialty into account which is highly significant for time-series-based anomaly detection. However, the detected feedback is binary, especially, due to the influence of inaccurate confidence interval (CI), the false alarm phenomena occur frequently based on predicted models. Thus this paper proposes an Uncertainty Fusion method to realize anomaly detection. Firstly, in order to estimate the data uncertainty, the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is applied to perform the prediction with uncertainty presentation. Then, based on the GPR model, the improved k-fold cross-validation is combined to represent the model uncertainty. Moreover, the quantitative error index is designed to provide more detecting information for decision-making. Eventually, the effectiveness of the proposed method are verified by different simulated and open-source data sets, as well as the real application in mobile traffic data detecting. The quantitative results on simulated data experiments show the proposed method can largely eliminate the false alarms without sacrificing much detection rate compared with the basic GPR model. Especially, the experiments on periodic data sets with high Signal Noise Ratio have the better performance. And the mobile traffic data detecting proves the Uncertainty Fusion method can expand the basic GPR model to meet the real industrial requirements.

                                The Internet of Things (IoT) connects millions of devices of different cyber-physical systems (CPSs) providing the CPSs additional (implicit) redundancy during runtime. However, the increasing level of dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity adds to the system's vulnerability, and challenges its ability to react to faults. Self-healing is an increasingly popular approach for ensuring resilience, that is, a proper monitoring and recovery, in CPSs. This work encodes and searches an adaptive knowledge base in Prolog/ProbLog that models relations among system variables given that certain implicit redundancy exists in the system. We exploit the redundancy represented in our knowledge base to generate adaptive runtime monitors which compare related signals by considering uncertainties in space and time. This enables the comparison of uncertain, asynchronous, multi-rate and delayed measurements. The monitor is used to trigger the recovery process of a self-healing mechanism. We demonstrate our approach by deploying it in a real-world CPS prototype of a rover whose sensors are susceptible to failure.

               	   			Distributed fault diagnosis has been proposed as an effective technique for monitoring large scale, nonlinear and uncertain systems. It is based on the decomposition of the large scale system into a number of interconnected subsystems, each one monitored by a dedicated Local Fault Detector (LFD). Neighboring LFDs, in order to successfully account for subsystems interconnection, are thus required to communicate with each other some of the measurements from their subsystems. Anyway, such communication may expose private information of a given subsystem, such as its local input. To avoid this problem, we propose here to use differential privacy to pre-process data before transmission.

               	   			Designing secure cyber-physical systems (CPS) is a particularly difficult task since security vulnerabilities stem not only from traditional cybersecurity concerns, but also physical ones. Many of the standard methods for CPS design make strong and unverified assumptions about the trustworthiness of physical devices, such as sensors. When these assumptions are violated, subtle inter-domain vulnerabilities are introduced into the system model. In this paper we use formal specification of analysis contracts to expose security assumptions and guarantees of analyses from reliability, control, and sensor security domains. We show that this specification allows us to determine where these assumptions are violated, opening the door to malicious attacks. We demonstrate how this approach can help discover and prevent vulnerabilities using a self-driving car example.

               	   			A cyber-physical system (CPS) comprises several connected, embedded systems and is additionally equipped with sensors and actuators. Thus, CPSs can communicate with their cyber environment and measure and interact with their physical environment. Due to the complexity of their operational environment, assumptions the manufacturer have made may not hold in operation. During an unforeseen environmental situation, a CPS may expose behavior that negatively impactsits reliability. This may arise due to insufficiently considered environmental conditions during the design of a CPS, or – even worse – it is impossible to anticipate such conditions. In the U-Test project, we are developing a configurable search-based testing framework that exploits information from functional testing and from declarative descriptions of uncertainties. Itaims at revealing unintended behavior in the presence of uncertainties. This framework enables testing for different scenarios of uncertainty and thus, allows to achieve a certain coverage of those, and to find unknown uncertainty scenarios.

                                Acceptance testing validates that a system meets its requirements and determines whether it can be sufficiently trusted and put into operation. For cyber physical systems (CPS), acceptance testing is a hardware-in-the-loop process conducted in a (near-)operational environment. Acceptance testing of a CPS often necessitates that the test cases be prioritized, as there are usually too many scenarios to consider given time constraints. CPS acceptance testing is further complicated by the uncertainty in the environment and the impact of testing on hardware. We propose an automated test case prioritization approach for CPS acceptance testing, accounting for time budget constraints, uncertainty, and hardware damage risks. Our approach is based on multi-objective search, combined with a test case minimization algorithm that eliminates redundant operations from an ordered sequence of test cases. We evaluate our approach on a representative case study from the satellite domain. The results indicate that, compared to test cases that are prioritized manually by satellite engineers, our automated approach more than doubles the number of test cases that fit into a given time frame, while reducing to less than one third the number of operations that entail the risk of damage to key hardware components.

                                Structured and unstructured uncertainties together with external disturbances may pose considerable challenges in realizing desired path-tacking and lane keeping of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a novel robust adaptive indirect control method based on an exponential-like-sliding-mode fuzzy type-2 neural network approach for enhanced path-tracking performance of road autonomous vehicles subject to parametric uncertainties related to vehicle nominal cornering stiffness, road-tire adhesion coefficient, inertial parameters, and forward speed. A hierarchical controller is designed and the stability of the closed-loop system is ensured along with deriving the adaptation laws by employing the Lyapunov stability theorem. The conventional reaching law related to the sliding mode degrades from the system stability and introduces an inherent chattering of the controller input. The convergence law for the sliding surface is adjusted based on a variable exponential sliding manifold to eliminate possible chattering in the buffeting switch zone near the origin. The proposed exponential-like sliding surface guarantees the swift and smooth global asymptotic convergence of the tracking error toward zero. Furthermore, an adaptive look-ahead path-tracking error term is introduced as an auxiliary error criterion to improve the vehicle path-tracking performance. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified through Matlab/Simulink–CarSim co-simulations and comparisons with selected reported control methods for two different road maneuvers. The results suggested substantially improved tracking performance by the proposed controller with robustness to withstand against the perturbed parameters and external disturbances.

                                Many Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are composed of low-cost devices that are deeply integrated with physical environments. As a result, the performance of a CPS system is inevitably undermined by various physical uncertainties, which include stochastic noises, hardware biases, unpredictable environment changes, and dynamics of the physical process of interest. Traditional solutions to these issues (e.g., device calibration and collaborative signal processing) work in an open-loop fashion and hence often fail to adapt to the uncertainties after system deployment. In this article, we propose an adaptive system-level calibration approach for a class of CPS systems whose primary objective is to detect events or targets of interest. Through collaborative data fusion, our calibration approach features a feedback control loop that exploits system heterogeneity to mitigate the impact of aforementioned uncertainties on the system performance. In contrast to existing heuristic-based solutions, our control-theoretical calibration algorithm can ensure provable system stability and convergence. We also develop a routing algorithm for fusion-based multihop CPS systems that is robust to communication unreliability and delay. Our approach is evaluated by both experiments on a testbed of Tmotes as well as extensive simulations based on data traces gathered from a real vehicle detection experiment. The results demonstrate that our calibration algorithm enables a CPS system to maintain the optimal sensing performance in the presence of various system and environmental dynamics.

                                Today's cyber-physical systems (CPS) span IoT and cloud-based datacenter infrastructures, which are highly heterogeneous with various types of uncertainty. Thus, testing uncertainties in these CPS is a challenging and multidisciplinary activity. We need several tools for modeling, deployment, control, and analytics to test and evaluate uncertainties for different configurations of the same CPS. In this paper, we explain why using state-of-the art model-driven engineering (MDE) and model-based testing (MBT) tools is not adequate for testing uncertainties of CPS in IoT Cloud infrastructures. We discus how to combine them with techniques for elastic execution to dynamically provision both CPS under test and testing utilities to perform tests in various IoT Cloud infrastructures.

                                A new context-aware data- and patient-centric paradigm for ubiquitous healthcare is central to deliver personalized healthcare solutions to the elderly and the physically challenged. However, this new paradigm requires real-time in-the-field processing of wirelessly collected vital signs using inherently complex physiological models and analysis of the processed information (derived physiological parameters) under context (e.g., location, ambient conditions, current physical activity) to extract knowledge about the health condition of patients. As the computational capabilities of biomedical sensor nodes are insufficient to run these models, an innovative resource provisioning framework that harnesses the computing capabilities of under-utilized electronic devices in the vicinity (e.g., smart phones, laptops, tablets, DVRs, medical terminals) to form a mobile computing grid is presented. The framework is imparted with self-optimization and self-healing capabilities for efficiency and robustness under uncertainty, respectively. The proposed mobile grid management framework serves as a key enabling technology for Internet-of-Things- (IoT-) based next-generation ubiquitous healthcare solutions.

                                With the rapid advances in sensing and digital technologies, cyber-physical systems are regarded as the most viable platforms for improving building design and management. Researchers investigated the possibility of integrating energy management systems with cyber-physical systems to form energy-cyber-physical systems in order to promote building energy management. However, minimizing energy consumption while fulfilling building functions for energy-cyber-physical systems is challenging due to the dynamics of building occupants. As occupant behavior is a major source of uncertainty for energy management, ignoring it often results in both energy waste caused by overheating and overcooling as well as discomfort due to insufficient thermal and ventilation services. To mitigate such uncertainties, this study proposes an occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical system that incorporates WiFi probe-based occupancy detection. The proposed framework utilizes ensemble classification algorithms to extract three forms of occupancy information. It creates a data interface to link energy management systems and cyber-physical systems and allows for automated occupancy detection and interpretation by assembling multiple weak classifiers for WiFi signals. A validation experiment in a large office room was conducted to examine the performance of the proposed occupancy-linked energy-cyber-physical systems. The experiment and simulation results suggest that, with a proper classifier and occupancy data type, the proposed model can potentially save about 26.4% of energy consumption in cooling and ventilation demands.

                               Internet of Things devices, such as video-based detectors or road side units are being deployed in emerging applications like sustainable and intelligent transportation systems. Oftentimes, stringent operation and energy cost constraints are exerted on this type of applications, necessitating a hybrid supply of renewable and grid energy. The key issue of a cost-constrained hybrid of renewable and grid power is its uncertainty in energy availability. The characteristic of approximate computation that accepts an approximate result when energy is limited and executes more computations yielding better results if more energy is available, can be exploited to intelligently handle the uncertainty. In this paper, we first propose an energy-adaptive task allocation scheme that optimally assigns real-time approximate-computation tasks to individual processors and subsequently enables a matching of the cost-constrained hybrid supply of energy with the energy demand of the resultant task schedule. We then present a quality of service (QoS)-driven task scheduling scheme that determines the optional execution cycles of tasks on individual processors for optimization of system QoS. A dynamic task scheduling scheme is also designed to adapt at runtime the task execution to the varying amount of the available energy. Simulation results show that our schemes can reduce system energy consumption by up to 29% and improve system QoS by up to 108% as compared to benchmarking algorithms.

                              The Internet of Things is the natural continuity of the Ambient Intelligence where smart and ambient environments are built mainly by integrating a large number of interconnected smart objects (sensors, actuators, Smartphone, appliances, etc.) with heterogeneous capabilities abstracted as software services. These services can be composed on the fly and provided, all the time and everywhere, to assist users in their daily activities. A key issue in user-centered services composition is to intelligently and effectively discover and select the most relevant services that best match the users' requirements and closely meet the specified quality-of-service level. Monitoring seamlessly the provided services and enhancing their quality, is still a challenging issue due mainly to the dynamicity and uncertainty characterizing ambient environments. In this paper, we propose a new service-oriented, user-centered and event-aware Framework capable of performing services monitoring to handle automatically events that may occur in ambient environments. This monitoring is based on a dynamic services discovery and selection process to enhance self-adaptation to unpredicted changes, and ensure services continuity with best quality. The overall proposed Framework has been implemented and validated through a scenario dedicated to daily activity recognition in an Ambient-Assisted Living environment. In addition, the obtained performances from extensive tests show clearly the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed approach in the case of a large-scale environment.

                             With the economic globalization and the intensification of market competition, competition between enterprises has developed into competition between supply chains. The influence and change of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology on the spatial structure and economic relationship of supply chain are all-round and profound, and then affect the allocation of resources and supply chain operation, which will lead to many new management problems. These problems will become a new field of enterprise supply chain management innovation. Based on the fuzzy theory, this paper uses six-point fuzzy numbers to represent the uncertainty in the supply chain and uses the possibility theory to establish the evaluation criteria for the overall performance of the supply chain. In order to satisfy the constraints of the final product order fulfillment rate and minimize the overall inventory cost of the supply chain, the model integrates and optimizes the manufacturing resource allocation strategy of the supply chain in the IoT. Finally, the effectiveness of the model is verified by simulation, which provides theoretical support for the decision-making of the supply chain enterprises in the IoT environment

                             Runtime uncertainty such as unpredictable resource unavailability, changing environmental conditions and user needs, as well as system intrusions or faults represents one of the main current challenges of self-adaptive systems. Moreover, today's systems are increasingly more complex, distributed, decentralized, etc. and therefore have to reason about and cope with more and more unpredictable events. Approaches to deal with such changing requirements in complex today's systems are still missing. This work presents SACRE (Smart Adaptation through Contextual REquirements), our approach leveraging an adaptation feedback loop to detect self-adaptive systems’ contextual requirements affected by uncertainty and to integrate machine learning techniques to determine the best operationalization of context based on sensed data at runtime. SACRE is a step forward of our former approach ACon which focus had been on adapting the context in contextual requirements, as well as their basic implementation. SACRE primarily focuses on architectural decisions, addressing self-adaptive systems’ engineering challenges. Furthering the work on ACon, in this paper, we perform an evaluation of the entire approach in different uncertainty scenarios in real-time in the extremely demanding domain of smart vehicles. The real-time evaluation is conducted in a simulated environment in which the smart vehicle is implemented through software components. The evaluation results provide empirical evidence about the applicability of SACRE in real and complex software system domains.

                            The intelligent manufacturing strategy and customer demand have mutually promoted each other. Also, the production mode is shifting towards customized production, and more rental resources or services are introduced to the production system, therefore, the systems are becoming more complex. Compared with traditional production systems, such systems have some new features, this work calls this type of system as a synchronized production operation system (SPOS). Under such circumstances, production systems are influenced by more frequent uncertainties, and the planning-based production decision and control approach is no longer applicable. The opti-state control (OsC) method is proposed to help SPOS keep in an optimal state when uncertainties affect the system. Besides, a digital twin-based control framework (DTCF) is designed for getting the full element information needed for decision making. Based on the comprehensive information of the production system obtained by the DTCF, the OsC method is introduced to the virtual control layer to formulate the optimal target guiding the path of the system in real time through the dynamic matching mechanism (qualitative perspective). Then multi-stage synchronized control with analysis target cascading (ATC) method is used to get the local optimal state decisions (quantitative perspective). From both qualitative and quantitative aspects to ensure the system is under an optimal target path for optimal operation procedure. At last, a case study in a large-size paint making company in China is used to validate the effectiveness of the approach.

                            Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) typically operate in highly indeterminate environmental conditions, which require the development of testing methods that must explicitly consider uncertainty in test design, test generation, and test optimization. Towards this direction, we propose a set of uncertainty-wise test case generation and test case minimization strategies that rely on test ready models explicitly specifying subjective uncertainty. We propose two test case generation strategies and four test case minimization strategies based on the Uncertainty Theory and multi-objective search. These strategies include a novel methodology for designing and introducing indeterminacy sources in the environment during test execution and a novel set of uncertainty-wise test verdicts. We performed an extensive empirical study to select the best algorithm out of eight commonly used multi-objective search algorithms, for each of the four minimization strategies, with five use cases of two industrial CPS case studies. The minimized set of test cases obtained with the best algorithm for each minimization strategy were executed on the two real CPSs. The results showed that our best test strategy managed to observe 51% more uncertainties due to unknown indeterminate behaviors of the physical environments of the CPSs as compared to the other test strategies. Also, the same test strategy managed to observe 118% more unknown uncertainties as compared to the unique number of known uncertainties.

                            Adaptive systems are expected to adapt to unanticipated run-time events using imperfect information about themselves, their environment, and goals. This entails handling the effects of uncertainties in decision-making, which are not always considered as a first-class concern. This paper contributes a formal analysis technique that explicitly considers uncertainty in sensing when reasoning about the best way to adapt, together with uncertainty reduction mechanisms to improve system utility. We illustrate our approach on a Denial of Service (DoS) attack scenario and present results that demonstrate the benefits of uncertainty-aware decision-making in comparison to using an uncertainty-ignorant approach, both in the presence and absence of uncertainty reduction mechanisms.

                            Self-adaptation is an established approach to deal with uncertainties that are difficult to predict before a system is deployed. A self-adaptative system employs a feedback loop that tracks changes and adapts the system accordingly to ensure its quality goals. However, making effective adaptation decisions at runtime is challenging. In this chapter we tackle two problems of effective decision making in self-adaptive systems. First, current research typically focusses on the benefits adaptaton can bring but ignores the cost of adaptation, which may invalidate the expected benefits. To tackle this problem, we introduce CB@R (Cost-Benefit analysis @ Runtime), a novel model-based approach for runtime decision-making in self-adaptive systems that handles both the benefits and costs of adaptation as first-class citizens in decision making. Second, we look into the adaptation space of self-adaptive systems, i.e. the set of adaption options to select from. For systems with a large number of adaptation options, analyzing the entire adaptation space is often not feasible given the time and resources constraints at hand. To tackle this problem, we present a machine learning approach that integrates learning with the feedback loop to select a subset of the adaption options that are valid in the current situation. We evaluate CB@R and the learning approach for a real world deployed Internet of Things (IoT) application.

               	   	Having a shared and accurate sense of time is critical to distributed Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Thanks to decades of research in clock technologies and synchronization protocols, it is now possible to measure and synchronize time across distributed systems with unprecedented accuracy. However, applications have not benefited to the same extent due to limitations of the system services that help manage time, and hardware-OS and OS-application interfaces through which timing information flows to the application. Due to the importance of time awareness in a broad range of emerging applications, running on commodity platforms and operating systems, it is imperative to rethink how time is handled across the system stack. We advocate the adoption of a holistic notion of Quality of Time (QoT) that captures metrics such as resolution, accuracy, and stability. Building on this notion we propose an architecture in which the local perception of time is a controllable operating system primitive with observable uncertainty, and where time synchronization balances applications' timing demands with system resources such as energy and bandwidth. Our architecture features an expressive application programming interface that is centered around the abstraction of a timeline - a virtual temporal coordinate frame that is defined by an application to provide its components with a shared sense of time, with a desired accuracy and resolution. The timeline abstraction enables developers to easily write applications whose activities are choreographed across time and space. Leveraging open source hardware and software components, we have implemented an initial Linux realization of the proposed timeline-driven QoT stack on a standard embedded computing platform. Results from its evaluation are also presented.

               	   	A fundamental problem in the design of closed-loop Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is in accurately capturing the dynamics of the underlying physical system. To provide optimal control for such closed-loop systems, model-based controls require accurate physical plant models. It is hard to analytically establish (a) how data quality from sensors affects model accuracy, and consequently, (b) the effect of model accuracy on the operational cost of model-based controllers. We present the Model-IQ toolbox which, given a plant model and real input data, automatically evaluates the effect of this uncertainty propagation from sensor data to model accuracy to controller performance. We apply the Model-IQ uncertainty analysis for model-based controls in buildings to demonstrate the cost-benefit of adding temporary sensors to capture a building model. We show how sensor placement and density bias training data. For the real building considered, a bias of 1% degrades model accuracy by 20%. Model-IQ's automated process lowers the cost of sensor deployment, model training and evaluation of advanced controls for small and medium sized buildings. Such end-to-end analysis of uncertainty propagation has the potential to lower the cost for CPS with closed-loop model based control. We demonstrate this with real building data in the Department of Energy's HUB.

                           The problem of building statistical models of cyber-physical systems using operational data
                           is addressed in this paper, using thecase study of aircraft engines. These models serve as a
                           complementto physics-based models, which may not accurately reflect the operational
                           performance of systems. The accurate modeling of fuelflow rate is an essential aspect of
                           analyzing aircraft engine performance. In this paper, operational data from Flight Data
                           Recordersare used to model the fuel flow rate. The independent variablesare restricted to
                           those which are obtainable from trajectory data.Treating the engine as a statistical system,
                           an algorithm based onGaussian Process Regression (GPR) is developed to estimate thefuel flow
                           rate during the airborne phases of flight. The algorithmpropagates the uncertainty in the
                           estimates in order to determineprediction intervals. The proposed GPR models are evaluated
                           fortheir predictive performance on an independent set of flights. Theresulting estimates are
                           also compared with those given by the Baseof Aircraft Data (BADA) model, which is widely used
                           in aircraftperformance studies. The GPR models are shown to perform statistically
                           significantly better than the BADA model. The GPR modelsalso provide interval estimates for
                           the fuel flow rate which reflectthe variability seen in the data, presenting a promising
                           approachfor data-driven modeling of cyber-physical systems.

            Localization underwater has been known to be challenging due to the limited accessibility of the Global Positioning System (GPS) to obtain absolute positions. This becomes more severe in the under-ice environment since the ocean surface is covered with ice, making it more difficult to access GPS or to deploy localization infrastructure. In this paper, a novel solution that minimizes localization uncertainty and communication overhead of under-ice Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) is proposed. Existing underwater localization solutions generally rely on reference nodes at ocean surface or on localization infrastructure to calculate positions, and they are not able to estimate the localization uncertainty, which may lead to the increase of localization error. In contrast, using the notion of external uncertainty (i.e., the position uncertainty as seen by others), our solution can characterize an AUV’s position with a probability model. This model is further used to estimate the uncertainty associated with our proposed localization techniques. Based on this uncertainty estimate, we further propose algorithms to minimize localization uncertainty and communication overhead. Our solution is emulated and compared against existing solutions, showing improved performance.                </td>

                     Recently there has been increasing engineering activity in the deployment of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). Different types of AUVs are being used for applications ranging from ocean exploration to coastal tactical surveillance. These AUVs generally follow a predictable trajectory specified by the mission requirements. Inaccuracies in models for deriving position estimates and the drift caused by ocean currents, however, lead to uncertainty when estimating an AUV’s position. In this article, two forms of position uncertainty – internal and external – are studied, which are the position uncertainty associated with a particular AUV as seen by itself and that as seen by others, respectively. Then, a statistical model to estimate the internal uncertainty for a general AUV is proposed. Based on this model, a novel mathematical framework using Unscented Kalman Filtering is developed to estimate the external uncertainty. Finally, the benefits of this framework for several location-sensitive applications are shown via emulations.                </td>

                           Long-lived, non-stop cyber-physical systems (CPS) are subject to evolutionary changes that can undermine the guarantees of schedulability that were verified at the time of deployment. At the same time, knowledge gleamed from extended periods of execution can be exploited to reduce the uncertainties that were inevitably presented in the system models that are used to define the temporal behaviours of the control tasks. In this paper we utilise this knowledge and present an adaptation method that actively extends the period of control tasks at run-time based on historical measurements. This can lead to lower power consumption or to the accommodation of increased computation resource demands from other components of the CPS. The method relies on online monitoring and model-based prediction to degrade control performance while having a minimal and acceptable impact on ongoing operations. Cloud-based computing is used to facilitate decision making and offload the local computation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method through control-scheduling co-simulation.                </td>

               	   	In this paper, the leaderless consensus control of a group of high-order strict feedback nonlinear systems with uncertainties under sensor and actuator attacks is considered. A fully distributed adaptive leaderless consensus control strategy is proposed to deal with the sensor and actuator attacks. Compared with existing results in which the model considered is simple, a strict-feedback nonlinear system is considered in this paper, which makes the problem more challenging. It is shown that all closed-loop signals are uniformly bounded and asymptotic output consensus is achieved in presence of sensor and actuator attacks. Simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.

               	   	Power cyber-physical systems (PCPSs) are becoming increasingly complex and diverse, benefitting from all aspects of societal issues. A PCPS is a next-generation system that is a tight conjunction of computation, communication, control, and power systems. The integration of Internet of Things and PCPS generates a novel energy system, the Internet of Energy, which is the future of the energy system. In the same way, the connection of bulk components and the extensive communications among them has brought many insecurities, uncertainties, and security challenges. Thus, a study of the analysis and synthesis of the reliability and security of PCPS is presented in this paper. By considering the unsafe uncertainties, models are formulated for a general cyber-attack, and a double-loop architecture for security defense is designed. According to this framework, security control scenarios are obtained from the character of each kind of cyber-attack. Finally, a separately excited dc motor with uncertainty is used as an example to demonstrate the problem.

                            Uncertainty is one of the most critical aspects that affect the quality of Big Data management and mining methods. Clustering uncertain data has traditionally focused on data coming from location- based services, sensor networks, or error-prone laboratory experiments. In this work we study for the first time the impact of clustering uncertain data on a novel context consisting in visiting styles in an art exhibition. We consider a dataset derived from the interaction of visitors of a museum with a complex Internet of Things (IoT) framework. We model this data as a set of uncertain objects, and cluster them by employing the well-established UK-medoids algorithm. Results show that clustering accuracy is positively impacted when data uncertainty is taken into account.

                        A self-adaptive cyber-physical system (SACPS) can adjust its behavior and configurations at runtime in response to varying requirements obtained from the system and the environment. With the increasing use of the SACPS in different application domains, such variations are becoming more common. Users today expect the SACPS to guarantee its functional and timing behavior even in adverse environmental situations. However, uncertainties in the SACPS environment impose challenges on assuring the runtime behavior during system design.
                       Software product line engineering (SPLE) is considered as a useful technique for handling varying requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for assuring the runtime behavior of the SACPS by applying an SPLE technique such as feature modeling. By representing the feature-based model at design time, we characterize the possible adaptation requirements to reusable configurations. The proposed approach aims to model two dynamic variability dimensions: 1) environment variability that describes the conditions under which the SACPS must adapt, and 2) structural variability, that defines the resulting architectural configurations. To validate our approach, the experimental analysis is performed using two case studies: 1) a traffic monitoring SACPS and 2) an automotive SACPS. We demonstrate that the proposed feature-based modeling approach can be used to achieve adaptivity which allows the SACPS to assure functional (defining execution of the correct set of adaptive tasks) and non-functional (defining execution of SACPS in the expected mode) correctness at runtime. The experimental results show that the feature-based SACPS demonstrates significant improvement in terms of self-configuration time, self-adaptation time and scalability with less probability of failure in different environmental situations.

               	   The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to connect billions of devices, that will interact with their physical environment through sensors or actuators. The measurements created from these sensors have varying levels of precision, leading to measurements that follow a distribution, whose variance presents an additional challenge for the employed security schemes. In this work we assume a smart attacker would attempt to mask his attack in the inherent uncertainty of the measurements, and attempt to manipulate the distribution of measurements as covertly as possible to affect the final meaningful value that the system would result in. We employ Game Theory to examine the best strategies to slowly corrupt the integrity of an IoT network, similar to ETSI's Low Throughput Networks (LTN). We examine the extent of the changes that can be made to the distribution without assuming a priori knowledge of it by the attacker, for different scenarios and compromisation patterns. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to examine the limits of the compromise that could be applied by a smart attacker on an IoT/LTN-type network without triggering outlier-alarms, and can be applied in the design of better targeted defensive measures.

               	   			Self-adaptation provides a principled way to deal with software systems’ uncertainty during operation. Examples of such uncertainties are disturbances in the environment, variations in sensor readings, and changes in user requirements. As more systems with strict goals require self-adaptation, the need for formal guarantees in self-adaptive systems is becoming a high-priority concern. Designing self-adaptive software using principles from control theory has been identified as one of the approaches to provide guarantees. In general, self-adaptation covers a wide range of approaches to maintain system requirements under uncertainty, ranging from dynamic adaptation of system parameters to runtime architectural reconfiguration. Existing control-theoretic approaches have mainly focused on handling requirements in the form of setpoint values or as quantities to be optimized. Furthermore, existing research primarily focuses on handling uncertainty in the execution environment. This article presents SimCA*, which provides two contributions to the state-of-the-art in control-theoretic adaptation: (i) it supports requirements that keep a value above and below a required threshold, in addition to setpoint and optimization requirements; and (ii) it deals with uncertainty in system parameters, component interactions, system requirements, in addition to uncertainty in the environment. SimCA* provides guarantees for the three types of requirements of the system that is subject to different types of uncertainties. We evaluate SimCA* for two systems with strict requirements from different domains: an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle system used for oceanic surveillance and an Internet of Things application for monitoring a geographical area. The test results confirm that SimCA* can satisfy the three types of requirements in the presence of different types of uncertainty.

                                Process algebra is one of the best suitable formal methods to model smart systems based on IoT, especially Smart Factory. However, because of some uncertainty, it is necessary to model predictability of the systems, based on the uncertainty. There have been several process algebras with probability, such as, PAROMA, PACSR, etc. However they are not well suitable for the smart systems, since they are based only on discrete model or exponential model. Consequently, only simple or targeted probability can be specified and analyzed. In order to handle such limitations, the paper presents a new formal method, called dTP-Calculus, extended from the existing dT-Calculus with discrete, normal, exponential, and uniform probability models. It provides all the possible probability features for Smart Factory with complex uncertainty. The specification of the modeling will be simulated statistically for Smart Factory, and further the simulation results will be analyzed for probabilistic properties of the systems. For implementation, a tool set for the calculus has been developed in the SAVE tool suite on the ADOxx Meta-Modeling Platform, including Specifier, Analyzer and Verifier. A Smart Factory example from Audi Cell Production System has been selected as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

                             Runtime uncertainty such as unpredictable resource unavailability, changing environmental conditions and user needs, as well as system intrusions or faults represents one of the main current challenges of self-adaptive systems. Moreover, today's systems are increasingly more complex, distributed, decentralized, etc. and therefore have to reason about and cope with more and more unpredictable events. Approaches to deal with such changing requirements in complex today's systems are still missing. This work presents SACRE (Smart Adaptation through Contextual REquirements), our approach leveraging an adaptation feedback loop to detect self-adaptive systems’ contextual requirements affected by uncertainty and to integrate machine learning techniques to determine the best operationalization of context based on sensed data at runtime. SACRE is a step forward of our former approach ACon which focus had been on adapting the context in contextual requirements, as well as their basic implementation. SACRE primarily focuses on architectural decisions, addressing self-adaptive systems’ engineering challenges. Furthering the work on ACon, in this paper, we perform an evaluation of the entire approach in different uncertainty scenarios in real-time in the extremely demanding domain of smart vehicles. The real-time evaluation is conducted in a simulated environment in which the smart vehicle is implemented through software components. The evaluation results provide empirical evidence about the applicability of SACRE in real and complex software system domains.
